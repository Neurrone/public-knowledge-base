<p>Burrs in grinders for coffee come in 2 types: conical and flat.</p>
<h2 id="conical-burrs"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading" href="#conical-burrs"><svg aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a>Conical Burrs</h2>
<ul>
<li>Doesn't require as much energy to work, so are used in both manual and electric grinders</li>
<li>Produce a bimodal distribution of grounds (grinds at the selected size as well as a bunch of fines or very small grounds)</li>
<li>Adds more body for espresso. Smaller conical burrs also work for filter coffee, but larger burrs (e.g, 83 mm) produce less clear filters</li>
<li>More suitable for use in medium to dark roasted espresso</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="flat-burrs"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading" href="#flat-burrs"><svg aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a>Flat Burrs</h2>
<ul>
<li>Requires more energy to operate, only found in electric grinders</li>
<li>Most people prefer flat burrs, more commonly found than conical burr sets in titan level grinders</li>
<li>Produces a more unimodal distribution of grounds, easier to align than conical burrs as they only need to be parallel</li>
<li>Produces espresso with less texture but more clarity for fruit notes in light roasts, can pull high extraction yield shots</li>
<li>More clarity in filter coffee, better than conical for filter due to generating less fines</li>
</ul>

<p>This is what SSP says about the 98MM burrs they have available:</p>
<ul>
<li>98MM high uniformity (HU): Single Dosing espresso, Clean cup, intensity, has a similar taste profile to the 64 MM unimodal multipurpose burrs</li>
<li>98MM low uniformity (LU): Espresso, brewing, bulk grinding, more complexity, Lower grinding temperature, used to be the default burr set in monolith flat max until the switch to Shuriken burrs.</li>
<li>98MM ultra-low fines: only suitable for brews (although I've heard some people having success with espresso but I'd imagine it'll be harder to pull shots)</li>
<li>98MM brew burrs: these are very new, there's a <a href="https://www.home-barista.com/brewing/ssp-98mm-brewing-burrs-t74971.html#p812987">thread on the HB forums discussing these new brew burrs</a></li>
</ul>
<p>While deciding on which burr set to get for the <a href="https://www.option-o.com/shop/lagom-p100">Lagom P100</a>, this is the response I got from someone on the <a href="https://espressoaf.com/">Espresso Aficionados</a> Discord:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think the question of "what burrs should I get?" is essentially unanswerable. </p>
<p>The question really comes down to a small portion related to the types of beans you like to work with and a larger part of the type of shots you want to pull. </p>
<p>Many folks prefer pulling faster 1:3 shots on 98mm HU, but I like HU for light roasted espresso pulled tight at 1:1.5 or less. </p>
<p>I prefer thick and juicy fruit bomb shots and for me, HU extracts enough of lighter roasts early in the pull to get me a high TDS and flavors that I prefer over longer shots that will be lower strength, but higher overall extraction. </p>
<p>I choose to balance extraction with brew temperature, rather than yield. If a shot is sour, I will pull it hotter, not longer. I only go longer when the tastes turn bad at hotter temps and it is clear that I need more yield to hit the sweet spot. But again, this is all meaningless unless you've sat down and had espresso with me and tasted what I make and said "yeah, I like that" or "nope, I want something different in the cup". Since I make espresso tailored to my tastes, my preferences are rather a moot point to everyone else...</p>
<p>LU is great, but for me, I like the punchy character that I get with HU more than the softer flavors I tend to get with LU. Both will dial in just fine and make very similar beverages, but HU will have a higher TDS at a given ratio and thus mouthfeel and -to a lesser extent- body are increased.</p>
<p>LU shots need to be shorter to match the mouthfeel of HU and since they are less aggressive on extraction, they require a slightly higher ratio to balance out the highs and the lows, which reduces strength and is just less appealing to my palate.</p>
<p>Others will have different preferences, but we are splitting hairs here. Really fine hairs.</p>
<p>For milk drinks, in not sure it much matters...</p>
<p>Think about it this way:</p>
<p>I pull short shots because I like the sensation of drinking them and the flavors pop. </p>
<p>In milk, if you extract more and have a less punchy shot as the base, you make up for that by adding less milk if the final beverage size stays the same. </p>
<p>So your option is less coffee and more milk with the tight shot or more coffee and less milk with the longer shot. </p>
<p>Seems to me the longer shot will cut through milk more than the short shot because it is equivalent to a larger dose of coffee in a fixed volume shot. I mean if you leave the basic recipe alone and just increase the yield, you are adding solids to a fixed-size final beverage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And here's another thread on comparative differences between the burrs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Based on second-hand experience and looking at the geometries and reading SSP's descriptions  this is my best guess:</p>
<ul>
<li>ULF is the one that gives you a semi-traditional espresso shot. Low outfall = more fines. But at brew range, it delivers the most clarity and the less fines. Will excel at 1:2.2.</li>
<li>HU has the most fines at spro range, it will extract fast and short. Good if you want high ey at 1:2.2.</li>
<li>LU is the one that has the less fines at espresso range due to the high outfall. It will extract slower and need a slightly higher ratio to reach balance. Good if you want high ey at 1:3 and mid ey at 1.2.2.</li>
<li>98 Brew is like LU but on steroids, higher outfall, even less fines.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>LU is generally seen as better for brew than HU and more forgiving of coffee flaws but more demanding on puck prep.</p>
<p>HU is the ultimate in clarity and has more fines so less demanding on puck prep.</p>
<p>Then there is the new SSP Brew which like the name suggests really is for brew not espresso</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Based on this, I decided on the LU burrs.</p></div></div><div style="padding-left:10px;padding-right:10px" class="ant-col ant-col-xs-0 ant-col-md-6"><div><div class=""><div class="ant-anchor-wrapper dendron-toc" style="max-height:calc(100vh - 64px);z-index:1"><div class="ant-anchor"><div class="ant-anchor-ink"><span class="ant-anchor-ink-ball"></span></div><div class="ant-anchor-link"><a class="ant-anchor-link-title" href="#coffee-grinder-burrs" title="Coffee Grinder Burrs">Coffee Grinder Burrs</a></div><div class="ant-anchor-link"><a class="ant-anchor-link-title" href="#conical-burrs" title="Conical Burrs">Conical Burrs</a></div><div class="ant-anchor-link"><a class="ant-anchor-link-title" href="#flat-burrs" title="Flat Burrs">Flat Burrs</a></div><div class="ant-anchor-link"><a class="ant-anchor-link-title" href="#differences-between-98mm-flat-ssp-burrs" title="Differences Between 98MM Flat SSP Burrs">Differences Between 98MM Flat SSP Burrs</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></main><div class="ant-divider ant-divider-horizontal" role="separator"></div><footer class="ant-layout-footer" style="padding:0 24px 24px"></footer></section></section></section></section></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"note":{"id":"6StB87ZNDD5AtnPANo_uL","title":"Burrs","desc":"Conical vs flat burrs","updated":1638007532189,"created":1624643148296,"custom":{},"fname":"coffee.burrs","type":"note","vault":{"name":"main","fsPath":"main","useFMTitle":false},"contentHash":"e3561d784ac2617eaf4a12f4549c90f7","links":[],"anchors":{"coffee-grinder-burrs":{"type":"header","text":"Coffee Grinder Burrs","value":"coffee-grinder-burrs","line":8,"column":0,"depth":1},"conical-burrs":{"type":"header","text":"Conical Burrs","value":"conical-burrs","line":12,"column":0,"depth":2},"flat-burrs":{"type":"header","text":"Flat Burrs","value":"flat-burrs","line":19,"column":0,"depth":2},"differences-between-98mm-flat-ssp-burrs":{"type":"header","text":"Differences Between 98MM Flat SSP Burrs","value":"differences-between-98mm-flat-ssp-burrs","line":27,"column":0,"depth":3}},"children":[],"parent":"543e830d-feac-4048-8075-58c406bc1105","data":{}},"body":"\u003ch1 id=\"coffee-grinder-burrs\"\u003e\u003ca aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#coffee-grinder-burrs\"\u003e\u003csvg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"\u003e\u003cuse xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"\u003e\u003c/use\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e\u003c/a\u003eCoffee Grinder Burrs\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBurrs in grinders for coffee come in 2 types: conical and flat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"conical-burrs\"\u003e\u003ca aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#conical-burrs\"\u003e\u003csvg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"\u003e\u003cuse xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"\u003e\u003c/use\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e\u003c/a\u003eConical Burrs\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDoesn't require as much energy to work, so are used in both manual and electric grinders\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eProduce a bimodal distribution of grounds (grinds at the selected size as well as a bunch of fines or very small grounds)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAdds more body for espresso.
