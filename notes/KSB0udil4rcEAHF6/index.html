<p>Many things we do in life are transparent to us and we take action without thinking about it. For example, our attention is on the contents of a letter we're typing, not on the act of typing on the keyboard itself. We think about other things on the drive back home, not on the mechanics of driving.</p>

<p>Breaks in transparency (breakdowns or breaks for short) occur when an <a href="/notes/86c2c093-d948-4a9b-844a-0900d2816b39">Assessment</a> is made that what's happening doesn't match with what is expected (i.e, it changes the normal course of events). For example, when typing isn't working, it is something you become aware of as it could affect your ability to submit a proposal in time, and you think about how to fix it.</p>
<p>Breakdowns are neither good nor bad, just the break in the flow of things. It is how we observe and navigate them that determines what is possible. Ontological coaching is about navigating breakdowns. The break in transparency is a moment of choice, to consciously choose how to proceed towards the desired result.</p>

<p>Coaching occurs only when there is a breakdown that the coachee declares. In ontological coaching, the breakdown is always in the observer, not the thing. E.g, the breakdown is not "boss is a jerk", its how the coachee / observer is looking at the situation.</p>
<p>The coach offers a conversation that allows the coachee to enlarge the observer that they are to take responsibility for the break they have declared. This is done by creating a context in which it becomes possible for the coachee to declare a breakdown. Some examples are contexts of lightness or intimacy. At all times the coachee should feel he/she is in a relationship of trust and respect with the coach.</p>
<ul>
<li>The amount of discomfort caused by the break in transparency declared by the coachee correlates with the strength the coachee has to start the transformation process.</li>
<li>The nature of the break reveals the limits of the kind of observer the coachee is and what prevents them from taking action about the break.</li>
<li>Understanding the cultural context and discourses of the coachee provides the context to listen for the breakdown, and assess its importance.</li>

<p>Our ability to deal with breaks is the mastery of living.</p>
<ul>
<li>Competency is the ability to work in transparency for a scope of action.</li>
<li>On the other hand, mastery is the ability to deal with recurrent breaks in the same scope of action.</li>
