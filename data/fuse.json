Fortunately, it is possible to move VMs to another location.\n\nAs of Apr 2021, there isn't a builtin command that does this easily, so it needs to be done by exporting and reimporting the VM, specifying a new location to store it during the import process.\n\n```sh\n# if Docker is running, shut it down first\nwsl --shutdown\nwsl -l -v # check that all VMs are stopped\n\n# export the VM into a tar file\nwsl --export ubuntu-20.04 \"D:\\wsl-backups\\ubuntu-20.04.tar\"\n\n# unregisters (deletes) the VM, make sure you have backed it up first\nwsl --unregister ubuntu-20.04\n\n# import from the tar file created earlier\n# in this example, the VMs are stored in D:\\documents\\wsl2-vms\n# in windows explorer, ensure that the folder does not have NTFS compression enabled (hyper-v machines cant start if stored in an NTFS compressed folder)\nwsl --import ubuntu-20.024 \"D:\\documents\\wsl2-vms\\ubuntu-20.04\" \"D:\\wsl-backups\\ubuntu-20.04.tar\" --version 2\n```\n\nOnce the VM is recreated, the default username that WSL uses to log into it needs to be configured again, otherwise it'll be defaulting to root:\n\n```sh\nubuntu2004 config --default-user <some-user>\n```\n\nInstructions from [this issue on Github](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/WSL/issues/412#issuecomment-629387956).\n\n### Moving Docker VMs\n\nThe process for moving the location of VMs used by the WSL2 backend is identical:\n\n```sh\n# shut down docker first\n# there are 2 VMs to move\n\nwsl --export docker-desktop \"D:\\wsl-backups\\docker-desktop.tar\"\nwsl --export docker-desktop-data \"D:\\wsl-backups\\docker-desktop-data.tar\"\n\nwsl --unregister docker-desktop\nwsl --unregister docker-desktop-data\n\nwsl --import docker-desktop \"D:\\documents\\wsl2-vms\\docker-desktop\" \"D:\\wsl-backups\\docker-desktop.tar\" --version 2\nwsl --import docker-desktop-data \"D:\\documents\\wsl2-vms\\docker-desktop-data\" \"D:\\wsl-backups\\docker-desktop-data.tar\" --version 2\n```\n\nExtremely annoyingly, the docker-desktop VM is moved back to the previous location on Docker upgrades. Fortunately, this VM is much smaller than the other one (which stores the actual image data).\n\n## Compacting WSL2 VMs\n\nTechnically this procedure is going to work for any hyper-v VM (.vmdx); it boils down to using diskpart to compact the VM:\n\n```sh\ndiskpart\n# in the diskpart prompt\nselect vdisk file=\"D:\\documents\\wsl2-vms\\ubuntu\\ext4.vhdx\"\ncompact vdisk\n```\n\nReference: [How to Shrink a WSL2 Virtual Disk](https://stephenreescarter.net/how-to-shrink-a-wsl2-virtual-disk/)\n\n## Fix Broken Port Forwarding\n\nIf a service is running in WSL2 but you can't access it from the Windows host by doing localhost:<portNumber>:\n\n1. Shut down WSL2: `wsl --shutdown`\n2. In the start menu, search for \"network reset\" to access that settings screen, and choose reset now. Note that this will require reconfiguring network settings and re-entering wifi passwords.\n3. Restart the machine.

This is something that is being actively worked on, although it will probably be several months before this is a fixed.\n\nIronically, the easiest workaround for this is to use the version of ssh that comes with [Git For Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/).\n\n1. Install Git For Windows. These instructions assume that its in the default location of `C:\\Program Files\\Git`, adjust as needed.\n2. The version of ssh that comes with Git For Windows does support fido2. However, it isn't able to talk to the YubiKey or other compatible devices on Windows.\n\n   This is where the [openssh-sk-winhello](https://github.com/tavrez/openssh-sk-winhello) middleware comes in. It allows ssh to connect with these authenticators via the Windows Hello API.\n\n   Download the appropriate release of `winhello.dll` depending on the version of ssh in Git for Windows (v2.0 for my case).\n\n3. Copy `winhello.dll` to `C:\\Program Files\\Git\\usr\\lib\\ssh`\n4. Add the following lines to `~/.ssh/config` (this will map back to `c:\\users\\<username>\\.ssh\\config` on windows):\n\n   ```\n   Host *\n       SecurityKeyProvider winhello.dll\n   ```\n\n5. Configure Bash to have ssh-keygen and ssh-agent use `winhello.dll`. Add this line to `~/.bashrc` (which will be in your user folder on windows):\n\n   ```bash\n   # this must be an absolute path, relative paths won't work\n   export SSH_SK_PROVIDER=/usr/lib/ssh/winhello.dll\n   ```\n\n   `/usr/lib` from within git bash maps back to `C:\\Program Files\\Git\\usr\\lib` on windows.\n\n6. Launch git bash by typing \"git bash\" in the start menu to get to the shortcut.\n7. Generate a SSH keypair resident on the YubiKey:\n\n   ```sh\n   ssh-keygen -t ed25519-sk -O resident -C 'YubiKey 5C NFC' -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_sk\n   ```\n\n   If everything is set up correctly, you should be prompted to enter the pin for the YubiKey and to touch the device.\n\n8. There should be 2 new files in your ssh folder. Copy the public key to a server you want to access. The private key is a stub that refers to the authenticator. From within git bash, try accessing a server via ssh with this new key.\n\n### Alternative Solutions\n\n- [windows-fido-bridge](https://github.com/mgbowen/windows-fido-bridge) is another OpenSSH middleware that has similar functionality as winhelper. However, it requires ssh 8.3 and above, which doesn't come with Ubuntu 20.04.\n\n## WSL2\n\nWSL2 has experimental support for USB devices, although it [doesn't work with Fido2 devices yet](https://github.com/dorssel/usbipd-win/discussions/127).\n\nTo work around this issue, [openssh-sk-winhello can be set to accessed from WSL2](https://github.com/tavrez/openssh-sk-winhello/blob/master/WSL.md) via ssh-sk-helper, which acts as a bridge from WSL2 to the ssh tools set up above in git bash.\n\nGit bash comes with ssh-sk-helper already, so that doesn't need to be installed separately.\n\n1. In WSL2, add the following to `~/.ssh/config` (note the windows-style path):\n\n   ```\n   Host *\n     SecurityKeyProvider \"c:/Program Files/Git/usr/lib/ssh/winhello.dll\"\n   ```\n\n2. Add the following environment variables to configure ssh in WSL2 to use ssh-sk-helper and winhello:\n\n   ```sh\n   # see https://github.com/tavrez/openssh-sk-winhello/blob/master/WSL.md\n   export SSH_SK_HELPER=\"/mnt/c/Program Files/Git/usr/lib/ssh/ssh-sk-helper.exe\"\n   export SSH_SK_PROVIDER=\"c:/Program Files/Git/usr/lib/ssh/winhello.dll\"\n   ```\n\n3. Copy the following .dll files from `C:\\Program Files\\Git\\usr\\bin` to `C:\\Program Files\\Git\\usr\\lib\\ssh` so that ssh-sk-helper has the DLLs it needs to run when invoked from WSL2:\n\n   - msys-2.0.dll\n   - msys-cbor-0.8.dll\n   - msys-crypto-1.1.dll\n   - msys-fido2-1.dll\n   - msys-gcc_s-seh-1.dll\n   - msys-z.dll\n\n4. If everything is set up correctly, you should be prompted to enter a pin and touch the device when generating an ssh keypair via the YubiKey.\n\n## References\n\n- [Setting up FIDO2 authentication on Linux from Windows - mooltipass/minible Wiki](https://github-wiki-see.page/m/mooltipass/minible/wiki/Setting-up-FIDO2-authentication-on-Linux-from-Windows)\n- [A Better Windows 10+WSL SSH Experience](https://polansky.co/blog/a-better-windows-wsl-openssh-experience/)\n","n":0.042}}},{"i":43,"$":{"0":{"v":"Windows Networking","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"\n\n## Remapping Letter Of Mapped Network Drive\n\nI saw this in [this forum post](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-networking/changing-drive-letter-of-a-mapped-network-drive/89d53c88-3b3a-4b4b-9508-6e7799258f4a)\n\n1.

Posted here for archival in case the [original link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/o19qxjggnfnm0t2/vac.txt?dl=0) gets taken down.\n\nBasic introduction to virtual Audio Cable and some of its applications:\n\nThis document is a basic overview of how to use Virtual Audio cable with some theory and tips at the bottom.\nMany people wish to mix computer audio, game sounds, music or other material together and place the result onto a chat session such as zoom/teamtalk/skype/teamspeak etc.\nOthers wish to record and edit the audio output of other programs for various purposes.\nTo do this you will need the full version of virtual Audio cable installed.\nYou can purchase this here:\nhttps://vac.muzychenko.net/en/\n\nI am far from the only one who uses VAC, other people have written software to help use it.\nDoug Lee has written a couple of tools over the years to ease cable usage, I link to his resources here but am unable to answer specific questions about them unless I have tried them myself.\nThere are all sorts of goodies on http://www.dlee.org/\nsuch as:\nThe Audio director for controlling repeaters: https://www.dlee.org/audir/\nVirtual Audio Cable Jaws scripts: https://www.dlee.org/vac/\nVirtual Audio Cable NVDA add-on: https://www.dlee.org/vac/NVDA/\n\nYou might be able to simplify switching audio devices if you get yourself in a mess by using the following utility:\nhttps://soundswitch.aaflalo.me/\n\nThere is a free version of Virtual audio cable, however it is limited to 1 cable and 1 connected client. This means that the free version will allow you to route audio from a playing application to a teamtalk instance see below: however the more complex routing will be unavailable in the free version.\n\nPlease note you must completely uninstall any older version of Virtual Audio Cable before installing a new one or you may experience system instability and unpredictable behaviour that will be difficult to debug.\n\nOnce you have the zip downloaded: uncompress it into an empty folder preserving the paths inside the archive.\nThe inbuilt Windows unzip functionality will do this if you extract to an empty folder or use a 3rd party utility such as 7zip.\n\nYou can get 7zip from http://www.7zip.org/\n\nRun the setup utility and optionally read the help documentation before you install VAC. Make your way through the install however note the warning below.\n\nWarning: If special care is not taken you may loose speech during the VAC install.\n\nIf you are using speech and screen reading software care must be taken when installing VAC or you may end up in a situation where you loose speech.\nIf you have operational braille working then you can use this to recover from this however I will give you instructions on how to restore system operation in the case that you do not.\n\nA tip from twitter user @simon818 is to rename your audio devices to names that all start with different letters before you install.\nTo do this open the sound control pannel start -> run -> mmsys.cpl\nFind each device in the playback and the recording listview, select it and tab to properties.\nAdd a unique string to the beginning of the friendly name shown on screen, so in my system I have Headphones realtek...\nand Empty Line-in 1-2\nso if I hit h when selecting a card below it will select the right device.\n\nWhen installing VAC the driver adds audio endpoints to the system.\nThe default action when a new playback endpoint is added is to switch the default audio device to the newly added device. This allows say a USB headset to start working the first time it is plugged in.\nthe problem here is that if your screen reader is set to use your default device, and the default device changes, you will most likely loose speech. Your speech will be redirected to one of the cables and as there is nothing connected to the other end you will hear silence.\nIf you have sighted assistance it is possible to allow the setup utility to open the sound control pannel and restore the default device easily.\n\nIf speech is lost: there are a number of ways to avoid this and methods to fix it if it occurs.\n\nIf you set your screen reader to a specific soundcard, and stop it from using Microsoft Sound Mapper,\nit will not be impacted as badly if the system default audio device changes.\n\nTo do this:\nNVDA:\nControl NVDA s, pick your synthesizer if necessary then hit tab once to get to the soundcard list.\nArrow up and or down to select the card you wish to put speech on.\nIf the first letter is unique you can hit that letter in stead of arrowing around.\nNow tab to okay and hit space.\nIf you want to save the settings hit NVDA-n, and cursor up to save configuration.\nRelaunch NVDA to make sure the change took.\nIf you loose speech after the VAC install with NVDA simply relaunch it and speech will return.\n\nJaws:\nPress Jaws+j to focus the Jaws window.\nIf Jaws is in the alt-tab order, hit alt-u and then o to activate the soundcard menu.\nIf Jaws is running from the System tray hit u followed by o to activate the soundcard menu.\nHit right-arrow to expand the menu and use your up and down arrows to select where you want the speech to be sent. Hitting enter will confirm your choice and Jaws will continue to use this soundcard unless it is changed or becomes unavailable.\nIf your soundcards have unique start letters you can hit the letter after hitting right arrow without having to cursor to the device.\n\nNarrator:\nIf Narrator home shows up when you launch narrator simply tab through the dialofg until you find the \"Select where I here Narrator's voice\" and select the soundcard you wish to use by default.\nSpeech should then shift to that card, close the settings window when done.\n\nSupanova: happy to take contributions for this section.\n\nIf you didn't want to change the default sound card for any reason and you have lost speech after the VAC install proceed as follows:\n\nWarning these are trial and error methods so locking the speech to a card before you begin is highly recommended.\n\nNVDA:\ncontrol NVDA s then hit tab to focus the sound card selection list.\nHome wil take you to the top of the list which is microsoft sound mapper.\nHit down arrow once to select the first soundcard and hit enter.\nIf this fails: hit control-NVDA-s, tab, home then down arrow twice to select the second sound card.\nRepeat with 3 down arrows and increase the number until you get sound back.\nYou may wish to save NVDA settings once sound returns until you reset the default audio device back to the original setting.\n\nNVDA usually remembers the last sound card so if you have selected one near the top you can often shortcut with NVDA-control-s <tab> down-arrow then enter.\n\nJAWS:\nSee the above text for how to select a soundcard in Jaws but note that whenever you hit right arrow to open the soundcard menu it defaults to Windows default sound card.\nUsing successive down arrow presses at this point will allow you to select another audio device and enter to confirm.\nJAWS window, utilities then soundcard with a right arrow to try another permutation.\n\nOnce you have VAC installed:\n\nOpen the control pannel as administrator under the virtual audio cable submenu inside all programs.\nChange the edit spin box for the number of cables from 1 to 3 and hit set to create 3 cables.\n\nYou may require more or fewer cables however be warned if you set cables to too high a number, it can delay windows startup as each sound device is enumerated. Perhaps rethink your setup if you need more than 5 cables.\n\nyou can check your device list by running start ->run ->mmsys.cpl\n\nIf this works correctly you will see lines 1 through N where N is the number of cables. You can rename these devices if that makes things easier for you.\nin the device list. .\nIf you have 3 cables you should see 3 end-points in the playback mixer and 3 end-points in the record mixer. See the technical section for an explanation of this.\n\nquick and dirty teamtalk streaming method:\nIf you just want to play stuff onto Teamtalk and you don't require the complexity of mixing,\nsimply use a second instance of teamtalk.\nWhen inside teamtalk do file ->new client instance.\nConfigure the devices on the second instance to reference a cable as an input so microphone line 1 or similar.\nUnsubscribe it from all the audio on the server, and tell it to record from a line. then simply send your player application to that line.\nYou might for example set winamp playback to line 1.\n\nYou may wish to configure a listen on that line to your output device so you hear the routed audio yourself. Note this will only work with the paid version of Virtual Audio Cable as an extra listen would violate the single client limitation of the free version.\nTo unsubscribe the second instance find all the users in the channel and hit control 4 on them to not receive their audio.\nYou can also globally mute the second instance if that is easier. Inside the second instance hit control shift m to mute voice coming back from the server, and control alt m to mute anyone streaming media files.\n\nIf you get serious about this sort of setup you can use a portable copy of Teamtalk with separate settings so that you are not constantly reconfiguring the second instance each time you want to use it. Making teamtalk portable is covered in the teamtalk help.\n\nMore complex mixing:\nNow to set up what you need to mix your microphone and game sounds together.\nYou must access the sound control pannel aplet.\nEither do this from the task tray or hit start, type in sound, and down arrow to the soun selection under control pannel in the results list and press enter.\nAlternatively you can do windows r and key in mmsys.cpl\n\nYou will need to hook devices together with the \"listen to this device\" option so I'll cover how to do this before detailing the hookups you will need.\nNote that listen to only works for recording devices so make sure you are looking for it under the recording tab.\n\nOnce the sound applet is open select the record tab.\nFind your Device you wish to listen to in the list view and tab to properties.\nNow select the listen tab. check the Listen to this device checkbox and tell it to send the output to the desired output device. Now hit the apply button.\n\nI provide only a few examples on how to set some routing up, but ultimately you will wish to modify these configurations to suit your use cases.\n\nHere are some setups you can use to get computer audio sounds and your voice into an audio chat application:\n\nNote you tell the first device to listen to this device and set the output device to the second device:\n\nno repeaters method:\nlisten line 1 to line 3.\nlisten line 2 to line 3.\nlisten line 3 to speakers.\n\nEssentially line1 and line 2 are mixed together and sent to line 3. Line 3 outputs to your output device so you can hear it.\n\nYou can listen to your microphone and send it to line 1 or 2,\nand send your winamp output to line 2 or 1, so basically feed media in on one line and vocals in on another.\n.\nIf your audio chat application pulls from line 1 it gets the media output, line 2 gives you the microphone signal, and line 3 the mix.\nNote that your microphone will be audible through your output device so beware feedback.\n\nIt is also possible to send teamtalk output to line 1 in this setup, and have it fed into SPL or similar as well as hearing the teamtalk audio yourself.\nIt is unclear how much system load these listens put on the windows audio subsystem so your milage may vary.\n\n1 Repeater method:\nYou use this method if you do not wish to hear your microphone on your output device.\n\nListen Microphone to Line2.\nListen line 1 to line 2.\n\nUse the audio repeater (MME) in the Vac menu to repeat line 1 to your speakers.\nYou may wish to reduce buffers to 50ms or lower to minimize the lag.\n\nNote that setting repeater buffers too low will put a high realtime load on your machine and audio streams may breakup up or become unstable.\n\nIf you do not mind hearing the microphone in real time do the following:\n\nlisten Microphone to line 2.\nListen line 1 to line 2\nListen line 2 to speakers.\nReminder: you will hear the microphone and your sounds mixed to the output device.\n\nHere is how the setup works:\nAnything you want to hear but you also want to show up in the final mix set that to output to line 1. This might include winamp, golf etc.\nThe repeater allows line 1 to be sent to the speakers so you hear content from line 1.\n\nAnything you do not need to hear but you want in the mix send it to Line 2.\n\nYou would send your microphone to line 2 if you do not wish to hear it it in real time.\n\nYou can leave the listens in place, unless they cause your system to lag.\nIn this case disable the listens until streaming is required.\nWhen you need to use the setup start your audio repeater from line 1 to the speakers. Tell your chat application that the input is on Line2.\n\nNote that VAC has both a Mic2 and Line2 device. Mic devices are mono, line devices are stereo.\nYou can only have a cable working as either a line or microphone at any given time.\n\nIf your application does not allow you to set output device you can change the system default to line1.\nCareful here, because if you close the repeater by accident you will loose all system sounds and have to set your screen reader to another card to get it back.\nThis can result in a loss of speech and can be tricky to recover from although if you know the hotkeys for your screen reader and how to switch sound devices you should be fine.\nBraille display can also help here.\nAvoid setting the system default to a cable unless you have no other option.\n\nIn recent builds of Windows 10 you can force certain apps to use a specific device by using the settings in the sounds dialog under system. This is often a better way to redirect a browser or similar application to use a cable.\n\nSelect line 1 if you just want game sounds,\nSelect line 2 if you want microphone and game sounds. the recording application should pull from line 2 if you want both.\n\nTechnical corner:\nThis section is here for those who want to build their own routing setups and wish to understand what is going on behind the scenes. It also contains some troubleshooting hints for tricky setups.\n\nVirtual audio cable is exactly what it says it is. The software emulates a physical cable similar to those you would use when patching audio gear together. One end of the cable is record and the other end is playback.\nThe software driver creates 2 audio end-points in Windows terminology a recording endpoint and a playback endpoint.\nYou can record from the recording side, and play audio to the playback side.\nAudio that is sent to the playback side is transfered as efficiently as possible and can be received on the record side of the cable.\n\nVirtual audio cable does not play audio itself, the driver only moves audio from one end of the cable to another and software must interact with these endpoints.\nIf you play audio into one end of a cable or record audio from one end of a cable without the corresponding process on the other end you will receive silence.\n\nVirtual Audio Cable supports multiple pins and all 3 windows audio methods, see the advanced section in the help file for details.\n\nListens? Audio repeaters, Windows audio session, KS: What gives?\nVirtual Audio Cable is just one component in the audio subsystem you may choose to build.\nYou have to get audio in and out of the cables in whatever method you choose which will best serve your needs. for this reason experimentation is required.\nPrograms that play audio can send audio into cables and programs that record audio from cables can receive the audio signals.\nWindows sound modes:\ncables support all the Windows audio modes including WSAPI wave out and direct sound.\nNote that unless you run WSAPI in shared or non-exclusive modes only one process can open an endpoint at a time.\nAlso beware sample rates are not converted in WSAPI mode so watch this when configuring.\nListens and repeaters:\nsince at least windows 7 there has been an option to allow you to \"listen to this device\" and send the audio to a specific output device.\nYou can use these listens to send audio from a physical device into your cable, or from a cable to another cable or physical device.\nListens are configured on a recording device under the listen tab, and you tell windows where to send the output. Once you hit apply/ok in the audio control pannel audio data is transfered immediatedly from one device to another until you remove the listen.\nListens are low latency with latency usually below 20ms.\nIf listens are so good why don't we use them for everything?\nThere are 2 main reasons why listens are not used for all routing inside virtual cable setups.\nFirstly: you can only have one listen per recording endpoint. this means that only 1 listen can record from an audio device at any given time and that stream can be sent to another output device.\nIf you set up a listen on your microphone you can only send the output to one other device. You are of course able to relay the signal from the second device wherever you want with whatever means you desire, see the 3 cables listen setup above.\nOnce there is a listen on the microphone you can not set up another one.\n\nthe second reason listens are not used for everything is that it is required to open the sound control pannel every time you change the listen configuration.\nThis is time consuming, and badly behaved audio drivers can reset devices when you close the audio control pannel possibly interrupting any streams or recordings you have running.\n\nEasy repeater control:\nIf you don't mind a little command-line magic you might wish to look into the Audio director software by Doug Lee, https://www.dlee.org/audir/\nIt will allow you to set up repeaters and configure them, although loading and saving configuration may prove more flexible than Audir in some cases.\n\nAudio repeaters what are they good for?\n\nIncluded with the VAC software are 2 audio repeater programs, an audio Repeater MME and an Audio Repeater KS.\nI'll explain how these work and what they are below. The help file that comes with VAC does contain all the details although it is sometimes rather technical in nature.\n\nThe audio repeater software which ever you choose to use basically acts as a relay between audio devices.\nthe repeater takes chunks of audio and sends them to an output device if one is selected.\nThink of it as a set of people carrying buckets of audio from one place to another.\n\nrepeaters have a number of configurable parameters and the 2 types of repeater have slightly different options.\nAudio repeater MME:\nThis uses high level windows sound calls to relay audio from one device to another. this means that format conversion, and other Windows audio processing may happen on the sound stream when it is relayed.\nThink of this repeater as opening cables using direct sound methods.\nIf one device is at 44100 samples per second and another is at 48000 samples per second, MME will insure that windows does an in kernel sample rate conversion for you.\nNote that the algorythm to do this is optimized for speed so if you can avoid sample rate conversions you definitely should.\nThere are a number of options in the Audio Repeater MME window you can configure:\nthe first combo box sets the input audio device. It defaults to the Microsoft Sound Mapper or the default windows audio device for recording.\nThe second combo box sets the output device which is where the audio is sent.\n\nIf you hit control c when you have an audio endpoint selected the name of the endpoint will be copied to the clipboard.\nThis allows you to use them in batch files or command-line scripts provided you quote them to protect them from the shell more below.\n\nThe 3rd field is the sample rate in samples per second.\nThe fourth field is the bits per sample.\nThe 5th field is the total buffer in milliseconds. It defaults to 500MS which will delay sound through the repeater by at least half a second.\nThe 6th field is how many parts the buffer is devided into. setting this >15 will generally not improve the repeater in any notable way.\nThe more parts you split the buffer into potentially the more stable the stream will be. Experimentation will be required to find the best settings for these parameters.\nThe 7th field is the priority of the repeater. Under windows 7 and later the repeater will try to make sure it sets the priority itself however you can override this. Setting real time priority can potentially freeze windows so be warned.\n\nFolowing the priority is a start button. Hitting this button will start the repeater process and it will begin copying audio from input to output device.\nAfter the start button you can specify the number of channels for the repeater. the default is stereo, If your microphone is mono and shows up as such you can set mono here to put it in the center of the stereo field on stereo chat programs.\n\nThere are load and save buttons which allow you to save your repeater configuration to a text file so you can easily restore them without having to constantly set all options.\n\nInterestingly enough the text files saved by the save button are an excellent start for writing batch files that start and manage repeaters.\nIf you remove carridge returns from the file and tidy up the options possibly adding /min you can start an audio repeater setup from a batch script and have them all minimized.\nAs mentioned above you can control C on an endpoint in a repeater and get the exact name for your batch file.\n\nIf you plan to automate a lot of repeaters you should look into audir see below.\n\nAfter the help button which does what you expect it would there is a prefill percentage which tells the repeater how full the source buffer should be before copying begins. it defaults to 50%.\nNote that your stream will be delayed by the prefill percentage as you won't get audio in the output stream until the prefill is complete.\nFinally there is a resync percentage which will stop sending audio to the output side of the repeater if the source buffer falls below a certain percentage. this defaults to 20%\nNote that when a resync happens there is a glitch in the audio stream so if your system can handle it best to minimize them when possible.\n\nBe warned that once you start a repeater running the screen display may become quite verbose. this results in a lot of speech and for progress bars to be chimed in NVDA. Minimize your repeater to silence this verbage.\nYou may also want Doug's Jaws script or NVDA add-on to help with this problem.\n\nKS repeater:\nThis repeater uses low level windows calls to transfer audio between devices.\nAs a result no sample rate conversion is performed and there are other limitations which I mention below.\nWhen using the KS repeater it opens the pin on the audio devices in exclusive mode to limit latency and increase efficiency.\nVirtual cables support multiple pins so it is possible to have multiple things opening these devices at the same time, however note that once the KS Repeater has a pin open nothing else can use it until the Repeater is closed.\nOther drivers may not support multiple pins so opening a device with the KS repeater may prevent it from being used by other software.\nthis means that if you send sound to the same card as your speech and the driver has a pin limitation, you may loose speech once the KS Repeater becomes active.\nSee the VAC help file for more information on the KS Repeater.\nIt should also be noted that KS endpoint names differ from MME ones so use the names given in the KS repeater if using it and do not share repeater configuration files between repeater types.\n\nUnless you know what you are doing you should probably stick with MME Repeaters or listens until you have done enough experimentation to understand how your system behaves.\n\nI am using a professional sound interface and a cable and my microphone is on one side in Teamtalk help?\n\nIf you are using stereo on teamtalk and your input source is mono it will show up on one side of the stereo image.\nto fix this use an audio repeater in stead of a listen.\nIn the audio repeater shift tab and set the repeater to be mono before selecting the input and output devices. this will put your source back in the center of the stereo field.\n\nAny comments or additions:\nplease email khoath@gmail.com or message khoath on twitter.\n","n":0.016}}},{"i":48,"$":{"0":{"v":"Synology","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n# Notes On Using Synology NAS Devices\n\n## Setting Up a Cron Job\n\n`crontab -e` won't work on a Synology; `/etc/crontab` needs to be edited directly under root.\n\n1.

For example, raid 0 stripes data across 2 disks but if any of the disks fail, this causes data loss. Do not use raid 0 in practice!\nBesides striping, parity can be calculated for data. Storing extra parity can allow the array to survive the loss of one or more disks.\n\n## Raid Levels\n\n- Raid0: plain striping\n- Raid1: a mirror, where all disks contain the same data. Commonly seen in 2 disk arrays. In an array of 8 disks, all the disks will contain the same data, capacity is limited to that of a single disk.\n- Raid5: striping with 1 block of parity, survives the loss of 1 disk. Considered unsafe due to the length of time it takes to rebuild a degraded array.\n- Raid6: striping with 2 blocks of parity, survives the loss of up to 2 disks.\n- Raid10: stripe (without parity) of RAID1 arrays. So in an eight-disk RAID10 array, you have four RAID1 mirrors, and your writes are striped across them.\n  A RAID10 array will survive the loss of any single disk—and may survive further failures. The RAID10 array can lose any number of disks without failing, so long as each of its component mirrors has at least one functional disk remaining. But when any component mirror loses its last disk, the entire RAID10 goes down with it.\n\n## Efficiency\n\nA striped array's efficiency is the amount of useable space that can be used to store data.\n\nEfficiency is (n-p)/n, where n is the number of disks and p is the number of parity blocks. So an 8 disk raid6 array has an efficiency of (8-6)/8 = 75%.\n\n## Parity\n\nThere is no \"parity disk\" in RAID5 or RAID6, because the parity block locations are rotated from stripe to stripe. Taking an eight disk RAID6 array as an example, disks 0-5 might contain data and disks 6-7 contain parity1 and parity2 on the first stripe. On the next stripe, disk 0 and disk 7 would contain the two parity blocks, and on the third stripe, disks 0 and 1.\n\nWhen a disk fails in a striped parity array, the data on it can be reconstructed from the parity on the remaining disks. Losing more disks than the number of parity block causes the data to be unrecoverable.\n\nRAID is not a backup! The parity just helps with avoiding downtime.\n\nFor wider arrays, performance gets worse when parity is used, this is called the RAID hole.\n\nThe RAID hole refers to the read-modify-write cycle striped/parity arrays must go through in order to commit any write smaller than the full stripe width. The values of parity blocks must be calculated from the data blocks of all disks of the stripe—so to write a single 4KiB block to a RAID6 array, the system must light up all of its disks—and it must do so in two consecutive, binding operations.\n\nSee [Understanding RAID: How performance scales from one disk to eight](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/04/understanding-raid-how-performance-scales-from-one-disk-to-eight/)\n","n":0.045}}},{"i":54,"$":{"0":{"v":"Password Managers","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"\n# Password Managers\n\n* [Why password managers implemented as browser extensions could be risky](https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/passmgrs.html)\n","n":0.277}}},{"i":55,"$":{"0":{"v":"Online Anonymity","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"\n# Online Anonymity\n\n* [The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Online Anonymity](https://anonymousplanet.org/guide.html) is an extremely comprehensive (and depressing) read on anonymity and privacy.\n","n":0.224}}},{"i":56,"$":{"0":{"v":"Homelab","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n# Homelab\n\nAlso see [[tech.zfs]]\n\n## Tutorials\n\n- [Perfect Media Server](https://perfectmediaserver.com/): a series of articles for setting up a server for media.\n","n":0.229}}},{"i":57,"$":{"0":{"v":"Home Automation","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"\n# Home Automation\n\n## Home Assistant\n\n* [setting up Home Assistant on Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/03/how-to-achieve-smart-home-nirvana-or-home-automation-without-subscription/)\n","n":0.289}}},{"i":58,"$":{"0":{"v":"Firefox","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n# Firefox\n\n[Most other browsers track users](https://www.unixsheikh.com/articles/choose-your-browser-carefully.html).

Each level has a salary range and they overlap: if level 4 is $125k-$155k, level 5 might be $145k-$160k. There are separate bands for base and equity.\n\nHowever, a higher level isn't just a free higher salary: it comes with higher job expectations. It’s better to be on the high end of lower level band. You should target a level you’re confident you can be promoted within 1 year and target the higher end of the band.\n\n[Tell the right story to avoid being downlevelled](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=hU6BVxtGd5g). But don't try to be moved to a level where you are not capable of performing at, as that is bad for everyone involved.\n\nWhen getting an offer, ask the following:\n\n- What level is the job offer? What are the requirements for this level vs. the level above it?\n- What is the salary band for this level? This is 100% completely reasonable thing to ask.\n- How much is the equity worth currently? You can also ask: what percentage of the company does the equity represent? What is the valuation of the company?\n- What is the vesting schedule? Is there a 1 year cliff? Are there quarterly vesting deadlines I should know about? Confirm whether the equity was quoted to you on a yearly basis or over 4 years.\n\nStart negotiating once you're convinced the level is right. Target a total compensation number that’s in the upper half of the band for your level.\n\nThe most reliable way to get more money is through competing offers. Consider interviewing with your 2nd or 3rd tier choices or getting a counter-offer from your current employer.\n\nIf you can’t get what you want, offer to shift between compensation components but don’t back down on total compensation. In order of difficulty: base salary, equity, signing bonus. Offer to shift some base to equity first and as a last measure, ask for a larger signing bonus.\n\n## Options\n\n- [Equity 101 for Software Engineers at Big Tech and Startups](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/equity-for-software-engineers/)\n\n## Mental Model\n\nDon't hesitate to negotiate for e.g, $x000 more.

You want to see is if the leader says: “We don’t have conflict.” This could mean that different opinions aren’t welcome, and the team sits in silence. Or the leader is trying to avoid the hard conversations that yield better results. The leader should be able to talk about people having different opinions they had to work through.\n* How did you start your last team meeting? Did they jump right into the agenda?  Did they have an activity or conversation to learn more about each other? You can learn a lot about interactions by how they begin meetings and conversations.\n* What is your ideal person for this role?  This is a great way to understand what the leader values and the knowledge, skills, and behaviors they view as making their work easier. They will probably describe the person’s organization, communications, skill set, or certain outcomes achieved. This response helps you get an idea if you fit with the leader’s ideal candidate.\n* Who have you promoted and why? If the leader has never promoted anyone, probe further to understand what is done to develop people. If they are a newer manager and haven’t had the opportunity, ask what they are doing to help grow and develop their team. It is ok if the leader hasn’t promoted anyone. What you want to hear is the thought around it and how they view their role in developing people on the team.\n* Tell me about the last person you recognized. Recognition can be a thoughtful conversation, an email, an award, or even a mention in an all-hands meeting. You want to see if the leader struggles to come up with an example or easily mentions individual and team recognition. Does the leader have the mindset that development includes helping people see the contributions they are making?\n* How do you focus on your own growth and development? Does the leader mention reading articles, listening to podcasts, reading books, having a mentor, taking courses, or having a coach? Are they actively trying to develop themselves? If they are developing themselves, they are more likely to develop their team. If they aren’t, you want to understand why. If they blame their schedule or struggle to find an answer, then odds are good your opportunity for development will be pushed aside. \n\nReference: [10 questions to ask in a job interview that will really expose a company’s culture](https://www.fastcompany.com/90622890/10-questions-to-ask-in-a-job-interview-that-will-really-expose-a-companys-culture)\n","n":0.039}}},{"i":71,"$":{"0":{"v":"Algorithmic Problem Solving","n":0.577},"1":{"v":"\n# Algorithmic Problem Solving\n","n":0.5}}},{"i":72,"$":{"0":{"v":"Hiring","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n# Hiring\n\n## Interview Questions\n\nQuestions off the beaten path\n\n* Walk Me Through Your Development Environment And Tools You Use\n* What Do You Do For Fun?\n* How Do You Learn New Technology?\n\n---\n\nReferences:\n\n* [The Responses I Got From a Software Developer Candidate That Made Me Hire Him](https://medium.com/illumination/the-responses-i-got-from-a-software-developer-candidate-that-made-me-hire-him-98ff8bf01298)\n","n":0.151}}},{"i":73,"$":{"0":{"v":"Tags","n":1}}},{"i":74,"$":{"0":{"v":"Todo","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n# Notes Tagged Todo\n","n":0.5}}},{"i":75,"$":{"0":{"v":"Sfx","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n# Sound Effects And Music\n\n* [list of places to find sounds and music](https://forum.audiogames.net/topic/28122/list-of-places-to-find-sounds-and-music/)\n* [Free voiceover generator](https://www.voicebooking.com/en/free-voice-over-generator): account creation is free and gives you more features\n* [interface sounds by ironcross32](https://freesound.org/people/ironcross32/packs/32802/)\n\n\n* [WavePad](https://www.nch.com.au/splitter/) can automatically split audio files based on silence detection.

This will degrade performance and could cause downtime.\n\nThese migrations can usually be done in a way that avoids downtime. Don't worry about this for smaller tables.\n\n## Adding Column with Default Value\n\nCauses the table to be rewritten in older versions of MySQL (blocking writes) and Postgres (blocking both reads and writes).\n\nThis can be accomplished by adding the column without the default, then changing the default value later.\n\nThis is safe and no workarounds are needed from MySQL 8.0.12 and Postgres 11.\n\n## Changing Column Type\n\nCauses the entire table to be rewritten.\n\nBlocks writes in MySQL except for the following changes which are safe:\n\n- Increasing length limit of a `varchar` from < 255 to 255\n- Increasing length limit of a `varchar` from over 255 to max limit\n\nBlocks both reads and writes in Postgres except for the following:\n\n- Increasing length limit of a `varchar` or removing length limits\n- Changing `varchar` to `text`\n- Changing `text` to `varchar` with no limit\n- For `decimal` or `real` columns, increasing precision or making them unconstrained\n- Changing between `timestamp` and `timestamptz` column when session timezone is UTC from Postgres 12\n\nInstead, do the following:\n\n1. Create a new column\n2. Write to both columns\n3. Update the new column with previous data from the old column\n4. Read from the new column instead of the old column\n5. Stop writes to the old column\n6. Drop the old column\n\n## Renaming Columns\n\nCauses errors in the application if the column is still being used.\n\nInstead, do the following:\n\n1. Create a new column\n2. Write to both columns\n3. Update the new column with previous data from the old column\n4. Read from the new column instead of the old column\n5. Stop writes to the old column\n6. Drop the old column\n\n## Renaming Tables\n\nSimilar to renaming columns, this causes errors if the application is still using the table.\n\nInstead, do the following:\n\n1. Create the new table\n2. Write to both tables\n3. Update the new table with previous data from the old table\n4. Read from the new table instead of the old table\n5. Stop writes to the old table\n6. Drop the old table\n\n## Adding Check Constraints\n\nAdding a check constraints causes all existing rows to be checked. This blocks writes in MySQL and both reads and writes in Postgres.\n\nIn Postgres:\n\n1. Add the constraint without validating existing rows using the `not valid` keyword. This skips enforcement of the constraint on existing data, but subsequent inserts or updates are checked.\n2. Validate the constraint in a separate statement for existing data: `ALTER TABLE my_table VALIDATE CONSTRAINT some_constraint;`\n   Postgres acquires a SHARE UPDATE EXCLUSIVE lock while validating the constraint for existing data , so reads and writes will still go through.\n\n   This 2-step process is also useful when there is existing data that violates the constraint. The process can be repeated until all violations are fixed.\n\n## Setting Not Null On Existing Column\n\nBlocks reads and writes while existing rows are checked.\n\nFor Postgres, do the following instead:\n\n1. Add a check constraint on the column with the `not valid` keyword to skip checks for existing rows: `ALTER TABLE \"my_table\" ADD CONSTRAINT \"my_constraint\" CHECK (\"some_column\" IS NOT NULL) NOT VALID;`\n2. Validate the constraint in a separate statement for existing data: `ALTER TABLE my_table VALIDATE CONSTRAINT my_constraint;`\n3. From Postgres 12, it is safe to then set `not null` on the column, then remove the check constraint.\n\n### Adding Index Non-currently In Postgres\n\nNormally, creating an index blocks writes till the indexx has been built. [Postgres supports building indixes concurrently](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createindex.html#SQL-CREATEINDEX-CONCURRENTLY) in a way that doesn't block writes:\n\n```sql\nCREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY some_index ON my_table(some_column);\n```\n\nThis is also applicable to adding foreign keys or references.\n\nThis is not needed if the index is being created with a new table in the same migration.\n\n## Linting\n\n- [Strong Migrations](https://github.com/ankane/strong_migrations#checks) is a Ruby gem that can lint for such unsafe migrations\n\n## References\n\n- [PostgreSQL at Scale: Database Schema Changes Without Downtime](https://medium.com/paypal-tech/postgresql-at-scale-database-schema-changes-without-downtime-20d3749ed680)\n- [reshape](https://github.com/fabianlindfors/reshape) is a new tool that tries to automate unsafe migrations for Postgres\n","n":0.039}}},{"i":82,"$":{"0":{"v":"Postgres","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n# Postgres\n\n## Configuration\n\n- [Postgresco.nf](https://postgresqlco.nf/) has recommendations for how to tune and configure various Postgres parameters, and documentation in a convenient readable format\n- [PGTune](https://pgtune.leopard.in.ua/) generates configs for various scenarios that can be used as a starting point\n\n## Connection Pooling\n\n- [PgBouncer](https://www.pgbouncer.org/)\n- [Pgpool](https://www.pgpool.net/mediawiki/index.php/Main_Page), apparently more versatile than PgBouncer\n\n## Gotchas\n\n- [PostgreSQL: Six Not-So-Easy Pieces](https://pgdash.io/blog/postgresql-six-not-so-easy-pieces.html)\n- [10 Things I Hate About PostgreSQL](https://rbranson.medium.com/10-things-i-hate-about-postgresql-20dbab8c2791)\n- [How we made DISTINCT queries up to 8000x faster on PostgreSQL ](https://blog.timescale.com/blog/how-we-made-distinct-queries-up-to-8000x-faster-on-postgresql/)\n  > PostgreSQL currently lacks the ability to efficiently pull a list of unique values from an ordered index.

Smaller conical burrs also work for filter coffee, but larger burrs (e.g, 83 mm) produce less clear filters\n* More suitable for use in medium to dark roasted espresso\n\n## Flat Burrs\n\n* Requires more energy to operate, only found in electric grinders\n* Most people prefer flat burrs, more commonly found than conical burr sets in titan level grinders\n* Produces a more unimodal distribution of grounds, easier to align than conical burrs as they only need to be parallel\n* Produces espresso with less texture but more clarity for fruit notes in light roasts, can pull high extraction yield shots\n* More clarity in filter coffee, better than conical for filter due to generating less fines\n\n### Differences Between 98MM Flat SSP Burrs\n\nThis is what SSP says about the 98MM burrs they have available:\n\n* 98MM high uniformity (HU): Single Dosing espresso, Clean cup, intensity, has a similar taste profile to the 64 MM unimodal multipurpose burrs\n* 98MM low uniformity (LU): Espresso, brewing, bulk grinding, more complexity, Lower grinding temperature, used to be the default burr set in monolith flat max until the switch to Shuriken burrs.\n* 98MM ultra-low fines: only suitable for brews (although I've heard some people having success with espresso but I'd imagine it'll be harder to pull shots)\n* 98MM brew burrs: these are very new, there's a [thread on the HB forums discussing these new brew burrs](https://www.home-barista.com/brewing/ssp-98mm-brewing-burrs-t74971.html#p812987)\n\nWhile deciding on which burr set to get for the [Lagom P100](https://www.option-o.com/shop/lagom-p100), this is the response I got from someone on the [Espresso Aficionados](https://espressoaf.com/) Discord:\n\n> I think the question of \"what burrs should I get?\" is essentially unanswerable. \n>\n> The question really comes down to a small portion related to the types of beans you like to work with and a larger part of the type of shots you want to pull. \n>\n> Many folks prefer pulling faster 1:3 shots on 98mm HU, but I like HU for light roasted espresso pulled tight at 1:1.5 or less. \n>\n> I prefer thick and juicy fruit bomb shots and for me, HU extracts enough of lighter roasts early in the pull to get me a high TDS and flavors that I prefer over longer shots that will be lower strength, but higher overall extraction. \n>\n> I choose to balance extraction with brew temperature, rather than yield. If a shot is sour, I will pull it hotter, not longer. I only go longer when the tastes turn bad at hotter temps and it is clear that I need more yield to hit the sweet spot. But again, this is all meaningless unless you've sat down and had espresso with me and tasted what I make and said \"yeah, I like that\" or \"nope, I want something different in the cup\". Since I make espresso tailored to my tastes, my preferences are rather a moot point to everyone else...\n>\n> LU is great, but for me, I like the punchy character that I get with HU more than the softer flavors I tend to get with LU. Both will dial in just fine and make very similar beverages, but HU will have a higher TDS at a given ratio and thus mouthfeel and -to a lesser extent- body are increased.\n>\n> LU shots need to be shorter to match the mouthfeel of HU and since they are less aggressive on extraction, they require a slightly higher ratio to balance out the highs and the lows, which reduces strength and is just less appealing to my palate.\n>\n> Others will have different preferences, but we are splitting hairs here. Really fine hairs.\n>\n> For milk drinks, in not sure it much matters...\n>\n> Think about it this way:\n>\n> I pull short shots because I like the sensation of drinking them and the flavors pop. \n>\n> In milk, if you extract more and have a less punchy shot as the base, you make up for that by adding less milk if the final beverage size stays the same. \n>\n> So your option is less coffee and more milk with the tight shot or more coffee and less milk with the longer shot. \n>\n> Seems to me the longer shot will cut through milk more than the short shot because it is equivalent to a larger dose of coffee in a fixed volume shot. I mean if you leave the basic recipe alone and just increase the yield, you are adding solids to a fixed-size final beverage.\n\nAnd here's another thread on comparative differences between the burrs:\n\n> Based on second-hand experience and looking at the geometries and reading SSP's descriptions  this is my best guess:\n>\n> - ULF is the one that gives you a semi-traditional espresso shot. Low outfall = more fines. But at brew range, it delivers the most clarity and the less fines. Will excel at 1:2.2.\n> - HU has the most fines at spro range, it will extract fast and short. Good if you want high ey at 1:2.2.\n> - LU is the one that has the less fines at espresso range due to the high outfall. It will extract slower and need a slightly higher ratio to reach balance. Good if you want high ey at 1:3 and mid ey at 1.2.2.\n> - 98 Brew is like LU but on steroids, higher outfall, even less fines.\n\n> LU is generally seen as better for brew than HU and more forgiving of coffee flaws but more demanding on puck prep.\n>\n> HU is the ultimate in clarity and has more fines so less demanding on puck prep.\n>\n> Then there is the new SSP Brew which like the name suggests really is for brew not espresso\n\nBased on this, I decided on the LU burrs.","n":0.032}}},{"i":144,"$":{"0":{"v":"Career","n":1}}},{"i":145,"$":{"0":{"v":"Software Engineering","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"\n# Software Engineering\n\n## Career\n\n- Getting experience smoothens the path. Software engineering is one job which does not require a degree (although having one does make things easier). Do whatever you need to to get experience at the start.\n- Don't switch jobs rapidly to move up the engineering ladder. The worst case scenario is when someone optimizes for success during interviews and then gets fired for incompetence.\n  Instead, get promoted within the same organization. This works much better because no one gets promoted for no reason. Showing progression in the same organization is very good on a resume.\n- Software engineers are partners with the rest of the business. That means they should have an equal say in features. Get a seat at the table, earn trust.\n- Learning by the pain of error is great for growth. Waking up in the middle of the night to fix a production bug ensures you learn from that mistake and will never do it again.\n- Places where you don't own the product and your mistakes are not good places for growth. Likewise if engineers are treated as \"code monkeys\"\n\n## Value\n\nSoftware engineers must add value.\n\nCode that does not add value (e.g, never deployed) does not matter, no matter how good it is. Such code arguably creates negative value because someone else needs to expend effort to understand what that code does.\n\n## Code Cycle\n\n1. Make it work:\n   - This also means ensuring it adds value to someone (consumers, some other system, etc)\n   - Also means making it secure\n2. Make it fast and Beautiful. This can depend on the business type.\n   - Speed is a feature for B2C (e.g, having pages load faster increases conversion), but is less so for B2B\n   - Making it beautiful is about making it maintainable\n\n## Growth\n\nAlthough growth has its downsides, it does fix many problems.\n\nGrowing the pie provides more time and resources for doing what you want. E.g, paying off tech debt\n\nAdopt a growth mindset even as an individual contributor. Engineers can grow the pie even in large organizations. E.g, proposing a feature with knowledge of how the code works.\n\n## Soft Skills\n\nEngineers work with people foremost, not code. Hence, soft skills are extremely important.\n\n- Writing is a high leverage activity. It means only explaining how something works once, instead of having to repeat yourself. It spreads the word about what you or your organization is working on. That helps recruit people and build reputation. The document will exist even after you leave the organization. Writing is thinking.\n- Present your ideas and talk about what you're working on to other people.\n- Set up team-wide initiatives that eventually scale up to being company-wide initiatives\n- Empathy is a superpower.\n\n## 10x Engineers\n\n- Knowledge work allows experience to compound. Solving many problems in the past provides a library of experience to draw from.\n- Their knowledge compounds, which makes the team more effective\n- 10x engineers make good tradeoffs. They can take on tech debt that can be paid back later.\n\n## Promotions\n\nGetting promoted has 2 steps:\n\n1. Add value\n2. Make noise\n\nAdding value without talking about what you did means no one else will know about what you did.\n\nPromotions are about future scope. What you've done in the past is an indicator of future performance, but it is about what you can do in the future, not what you did. Is there enough scope for growth of ownership for the promotion to take place?\n\nPromotions are also about demonstrating you can perform at the next level before you're promoted to it. That is an indicator about what you can du in the future.\n\nHave conversations with your manager and tell them that you want to get promoted. That helps align the world in your favour, as promotions aren't instant. They can help advocate or look out for opportunities on your behalf.\n\n> If your primary goals are about professional growth, even if you are not promoted, you will have gained valuable skills. These skills might be things like conveying engineering best practices, mentoring others, leading projects, sharing knowledge, and others. Focus on these skills over just the promotion. Promotions will a hit or miss, based on the process your company follows. But no one can take away your growth from you.\n\nAlso see [Software Developer Promotions: Advice to Get to That Next Level](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/software-engineering-promotions/)\n\n### Startups vs Big Companies\n\nStartups are about speed, wearing multiple hats / context switching, rapid iteration and MVPs to demonstrate value, taking on debt and fixing it later.\n\nBigger companies are about working well with others, doing things right and writing maintainable code.\n\n## Culture And Values\n\nFind a company with values that align to yours. Ask about what the team values.\n\nThe culture and values of a team will matter more than that of the overall company. But the culture of the wider company also affects that of the team.\n\n---\n\nReferences:\n\n- [Timeless Career Advice for Software Engineers](https://lbacaj.gumroad.com/l/career-advice-for-engineers)\n- [How to Build a Strong Career in Tech](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-build-strong-career-tech-thiago-ghisi/)\n","n":0.035}}},{"i":146,"$":{"0":{"v":"Engineering Manager","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"\n# Engineering Manager\n\n* [Reading list for new engineering managers](https://jacobian.org/2018/may/2/engmanager-reading-list/)\n","n":0.333}}},{"i":147,"$":{"0":{"v":"Accessible Software","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"\n# Accessible Software\n\nVarious pieces of software that works well with a screen reader and adjacent topics\n","n":0.25}}},{"i":148,"$":{"0":{"v":"Windows","n":1}}},{"i":149,"$":{"0":{"v":"Sound On Windows","n":0.577},"1":{"v":"# Sound On Windows\n\nGetting low-latency high quality audio playback is much harder than you'd think.

Trauma is the disconnection from it and healing is the reconnection to it.\n\nTrauma is not the bad things that happen you, but what happens inside you as a result of what happens to you.\n\nTrauma is a disconnection from self. You no longer have yourself when disconnecting. The disconnection occurs because it is too painful to be ourselves. This can become a lifelong pattern - not being able to deal with emotions, withdrawing from relationships when feeling hurt because of not being able to deal with the emotions. \n\nThis causes dangerous situations where you ignore emotional responses / instincts. For example, a child is being beaten by his father, and the mother has been abused before. The child sees two possibilities: my father is bad, or I am a bad person and would believe the latter. The mother has learnt to ignore her own feelings when seeing the child being abused as a result of her own trauma. This is intergenerational trauma. The child has no one to turn to and having limited resources, disconnects with himself.\n\nEveryone has a true genuine authentic self that can never be destroyed.\n\nUnder a traumatized persona, there is a healthy individual who has never found expression in this life because they were not given the venue for expression. If you can see that, you're trauma informed.\n\nTrauma involves a life long expenditure of pushing down to avoid feeling the pain. As we heal, the same energy is liberated for life and for being in the present. The energy of trauma can be transformed into the energy for life.\n\nChildren don't get traumatized because they get hurt; they get traumatized because they are alone with the hurt.\n\nWhen parents go against their instincts and allow a baby to cry when separated from them, this creates trauma when done repeatedly.\n\nChildren need attachment and authenticity (connection to to yourself). It is a survival necessity.\n\nWhen society does not allow this (e.g, a child expressing anger), the child is made to separate from themself and so learns to disconnect from anger. Instead of suppressing it, the child should be taught to regulate it, not to repress it.\n\nDepression can provide insight into how someone is abandoning themself.\n\nOur systems reward people who act from being traumatized. Their choices are unconsciously being shaped by trauma. The system will not be able to heal itself from the inside.\n\nParts of the economies exist because people buy things that provide temporary relief from trauma.\n\nTrauma-informed care requires a system to make a paradigm shift from asking \"What is wrong with this person?\" to \"What has happened to this person?\".\n\nOur disconnect from the earth is a parallel with the disconnect from our own bodies.\n\nModern medical science operate only on the biological plane. What if diseases like cancer or autoimmune disorders are manifestations of trauma?\n\nDiseases are normal response to abnormal circumstances. When recovering from an illness, think about what this mean about your life / relationship and how you treat yourself.\n\n### Responding To The Past\n\nTrauma shapes [[humans.language.assessments]].\n\n> We don’t respond to what happens. We respond to our perception of what happens. It’s with our minds we create the world.\n>\n> Number two, of all the possible interpretations, we choose the worse one.\n>\n> Thirdly, what I just said isn’t true, we didn’t choose it. It’s not like you went through all these possibilities and said oh no he doesn’t care about me and he doesn’t respect me, you didn’t do that. Your brain jumped there automatically. My question is why, is this the first time that you felt hurt and angry when you perceived someone didn’t care about you or respect you?\n>\n> \"It’s not the first time.\"\n>\n> Very good. And most people I talk to, it goes way back into childhood, and that’s what trauma is. We don’t respond to the present moment. We respond to the past. So who’s the one who doesn’t care about you and doesn’t think you’re worthy of respect?\n>\n> \"Oh it’d be me.\"\n>\n> It’d be you. Now that’s the learning. That’s the beauty of healing, when you reframe things and you actually see the source within ourselves, all of a sudden that’s liberating. Because guess what, if you’re feeling this way because this guy did this or didn’t do that, that makes you a victim. But if you see that you are the source, now you’re powerful.\n\n## Addiction\n\nAddiction is any behaviour a person craves to find short-term relief, but causes negative consequences and the person is unable to give it up.\n\nThe question is not why the addiction, but why the pain.\n\nAddiction is always accompanied by trauma.\n\nMyths about addiction:\n\n1. Addiction is a choice, therefore The individual is responsible for decisions arising from the addiction. Therefore, addicts get punished for being addicted.\n2. Addiction is inherited. This is more humane than the first, but ignores why people really get addicted. Its a normal response to trauma - to escape from the suffering. The addiction is a way of covering up the emtiness inside.\n\nOnce addiction is recognized as not being the primary problem but as a response to trauma, it is obvious that treating addiction involves healing the trauma.\n","n":0.034}}},{"i":163,"$":{"0":{"v":"Use of Self","n":0.577},"1":{"v":"# Use Of Self\n\n> A single person can change the system only if they are aware of what they're doing with themselves.\n\n1.

And this I must say is surely an act of love; for after over 20 years of meeting the needs of people in all levels of systems, I can tell you that this is a courageous and selfless act that is rare, and made even more difficult when our systems do not reciprocate.\n\nInterventions should restore abundance to the system. This requires that the intervener is also in a state of abundance to be able to give, only possible by managing the following types of debt:\n\n- _Somatic debt_: sleep, exercise, diet, ritual.\n- _Emotional debt_: moods affect our adaptability when we know longer experience a wide range of [[humans.emotions]], but a predictable response to similar situations.\n    The easiest way of dealing with this is to adopt [[temporary coping mechanisms|humans.emotions.coping-and-deplay-emotions]]. Since they only stop emotional spending and don't restore reserves, they can bring barrenness to a system if they become permanent.\n  - Attend to past [[trauma|humans.wisdom-of-trauma]], as it very likely affects how you see.\n  - Make it a habitual choice to [[forgive|humans.language.declarations.forgiveness]], [[humans.trust]] and accept which reduces strong moods of anger, fear and sadness respectively.\n- _Language_: pay attention to your [[linguistic experience|humans.language]] and how you describe and assess the world.

Language is unique to humans. Distinctions create tribes. Trust is the phenomenon that shows us we're part of the same tribe.\n\nThe 4 levels of trust are:\n\n1. _Sincerity_: the other person's internal and external conversations are not contradictory, the other person acts in according to what they say they believe and care about. Are their intentions clear?\n\n   This should not be confused for care, because sincerity is about intention. A graphic illustration of this is if someone tells their date that they just want to have sex. This demonstrates sincerity but not care.\n2. _Competence_: the other person is able to do what they propose by having the knowledge, skill and resources needed to accomplish the task.\n3. _Reliability_: the other person has kept their promises in the past, and will continue to do so in the future.\n4. _Care_: the other person has our best interests in mind and will act in ways that reflect concern for our well-being and what we consider important. Can you identify with them?\n\nEach of these aspects of trust is an assessment we make of the other person. If we don't trust someone, it is usually because one of these is missing. It is normal to have a bias towards focusing on one or a few of these aspects. When you decide to trust someone, this is a declaration.\n\nExamples:\n\n- The levels are sequential, which shows up naturally in the course of an interview. Starting off with sincerity, the other pillars of trust are established.\n  1. Sincerity: starting the interview with a question like \"Tell us about yourself and why you're here\".\n  2. Competence: \"You mentioned doing xyz in your resume. Could you tell us more about that?\"\n  3. Reliability: \"What are your plans for the next few years?\"\n  4. Care: further questions to see if you identify with the other person\n- Bad salespeople try to sell you something and might do so by disguising their intentions (lack of sincerity) or even when they are sincere, they focus on closing that sale (lack of care for what you need).\n- How Tong Yee builds the container at the start of each course / workshop - he is very intentional about addressing each of these 4 aspects of trust.\n\n---\n\nSome of this explanation comes from Language and the Pursuit of Leadership Excellence.\n","n":0.051}}},{"i":167,"$":{"0":{"v":"Human Systems","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"\n# Human Systems\n\nHow systems work and break down, how people act and interact in systems.\n","n":0.258}}},{"i":168,"$":{"0":{"v":"Why Things Are","n":0.577},"1":{"v":"\n# Why Things Are In Human Systems\n\nThese concepts explain why things happen in systems.\n\n1.

Avoid mixing it with other interventions.\n2. _\"I feel\"_: this is your emotion, mobilizing in you, it is not anyone elses. This maps to mobilization in the cycle of experience.\n\n   Avoid naming the emotions of others. Since you own your emotions, no one else can challenge them, vs other people challenging your assessments of their emotions.\n\n   Requires use of self.\n3. _\"Could you\"_: making a request to move the individual to action and contact in the cycle of experience.\n\n   This is a request, so the individual still has choice. There is a thin line here so be careful.\n4. _Grand theorizing_: uses abstract theories, concepts, generalizations and metaphors to make meaning of what was observed.

Providing the benefit of the doubt here refers to continuing to trust.\n\nFor example, showing weakness and admitting a mistake could immediately cause someone to doubt my competence and therefore, put less trust in me. If there is a culture of psychological safety, this is treated as a learning experience and I would work to avoid repeating that mistake.\n\nHowever, there is a balance to keep when extending the grace of benefit of the doubt. If someone is truly not performing and needs to be let go in a high stakes role, you can part ways and do so without destroying the other person. \"I can treat you as a friend, but I no longer trust your competence which is a critical part of what we're doing...\".\n\n## Safety Reveals Suffering\n\nThere is suffering when things aren't the way they should be.\n\nSafety reveals suffering, but _safety cannot heal suffering_. Hence, psychological safety is a means to an end (and not an end in and of itself) - the system is more agile or the team performs better.\n\nThis is because safety helps with diagnosis but not with intervention. E.g for conversation between friends, lots of things are discussed because there is a lot of safety, but people don't know what to do.\n\n## Safety And Competence\n\n_Psychological Safety must be matched with skill_. Once something is in the system that the system does not know how to handle, that causes safety to plummet.\n\nWhen doing systems intervention, remember to also diagnose how much competence there is in the system. Without competence, safety is premature.\n\nThe more competence in the system, the more issues start showing up, which might overwhelm the system.\n\nThis is also increasingly complex because other systems like friendship systems, family systems etc fail to catch units like unresolved trauma, ambitions or dreams which then shows up onto the work system. It is worth seeing if a unit of work can be taken care of in these other systems first.\n\n* * *\n\nMisc notes:\n\n- The lack of psychological safety is often associated with underlings in an organization. But many leaders also do not feel safe in the very systems that they are supposed to lead.\n- A tool like the staff climate survey can only be used in a culture which supports it. Leaders brace themselves for the results of these surveys in many organizations.\n\n","n":0.046}}},{"i":172,"$":{"0":{"v":"Power","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n# Power\n\nWork begins when there is desire to bring change. Power, the access to trust and influence, is needed for change.\n\n[[humans.trust]] is the basis of how power is used. Without trust, all types of power can be abused.\n\n## Power Is Assigned\n\n> Power cannot be taken. It can only be assigned.\n\nFor individuals that are perceived to be power hungry and have ceased power, they have coerced others and through that coercion, were assigned power.\n\nExamples:\n\n- A kidnapper threatens to kill your child unless a ransom of $10,000 is paid. There is a choice to pay the ransom[^1] and in that choice, this assigns coercive power to the kidnapper.\n- When the Germans took everything away from the Jews, the jews had nothing left. The Germans lost their hold on the Jews, since they chose not to assign any more power to their captors.\n\n## 8 Types Of Power\n\nThese are the 8 reasons that people would assign power. This is evidence-based from observation of human behavior.\n\nNew power isn't better than old power - each has their place.\n\n### Old Power\n\nTill the 1990s, these were the types of recognized power:\n\n1. _Legitimate_: power assigned to members of an institution, exists only if the institution remains. E.g, the family unit, monarchies, governments. The prime minister would no longer have any legitimate power if there is no longer a government.\n2. _Expert_: power assigned to individuals when they have mastery of a specific skill set.\n3. _Coercive_: assigned when someone has something they do not want to lose. This is not necessarily bad, e.g in the case of fitness instructors.\n4. _Reward_: assigned to someone which has something you want.\n\nThese forms of power are needed for leading and managing systems and to build systems up.\n\n### New Power (after 1990s)\n\nNew forms of power arising after the 1990s. Old forms of power diminish when affluence and knowledge increase. E.g, how the internet diminishes the influence of expert power.\n\n1. _Referent_: whether I can relate to you. Vulnerability allows leaders to be more relatable. E.g, Me Too movement.\n\n   Can be polarizing or fragmentary because some people will not be able to relate. E.g, people who are alienated because they cannot relate to the Me Too movement.\n2. _Information_: expert power is tied to experience and knowledge. Information power is tied to information and understanding of context. People who are in the grape vine have information power.\n3. _Moral_: practicing what you preach, whether people do what they say. Doesn't refer to goodness or righteousness.\n4. _Charismatic_: this is not charisma, though charisma is part of it. Refers to wholeness and health. We all experience aspects of life where we feel broken. Some people have done the work to heal. They have a quiet charisma, being whole and comfortable in their skin.\n\nThese powers are needed for healing and balance in systems.\n\n## How Power Relates To Be-Do-Have\n\nWith the [[humans.be-do-have]], the 8 powers can be plotted on a venn diagram with 3 components: be, do and have.\n\n- Have: legitimate, information and expert power are what you own.\n- Be ∩ Do: practicing what you preach, moral power\n- Be ∩ Have: referent power\n- Do ∩ Have: reward power - I can only give because I own\n- Do: coercive\n- Be: charismatic\n\n## Personal Biases\n\nEach person is biased about which power they respond to. For instance, a new director joining with little experience in the industry vs an assistant manager that has 25 years in the industry. Who would you assign more power to?\n\nAsians are biased towards using old power, since that is what they are shown as children. Legitimate and coercive power are the most commonly used in Asian parenting.\n\nThe takeaway here is to develop new forms of power for ourselves.\n\n## Alternative Paths To Success\n\nIt is commonly believed that you cannot affect change without legitimacy. For instance, from legitimacy, you gain expert then information power.\n\nToday, it is also possible to work backward. For instance, with referent power, you get more information power because people relate to you, which leads to expertise and legitimacy.\n\n[^1]: Most people would make the choice to pay the ransom, but it is still technically a choice\n","n":0.039}}},{"i":173,"$":{"0":{"v":"Patterns in Systems","n":0.577},"1":{"v":"\n# Patterns For Diagnosing Human Systems\n\n> The system can only respond to what the system sees.

Otherwise, they are in constant anxiety and may go so far as to eat their children to protect them from the anxiety.\n\nThe organism is in an environment. The instinct is always to gain data about the environment to decide whether it is safe. The more a mammal knows about its environment, the safer it feels.\n\nIf it is aware of danger, it retreats to safety. It enters the environment (go outside of safety) to survive (hunt for food, water).\n\nExamples:\n\n- I'm the organism in the FPC 2 cohort. Everyone else is the environment\n- I'm the organism, my team or another department is the environment\n\nEnvironments shift constantly, creating threat.\n\nWhen there's a watering hole, mammals go there for survival. But predators go there too. When the zebra and lion are drinking water, the zebra feels threatened by the lion. The zebra has no choice but to be there.\n\nBut if the zebra knew the lion has just recently eaten, there is some safety.\n\nIf there's a choice, the zebra will never stand next to the lion. But it does so because there's no choice, its needed for survival.\n\nThe zebra cannot change into a lion to survive.\n\nBut _humans can change and become different people_, depending on what container they're in.\n\nIn this analogy, Humans want to be the lion to avoid being eaten but they are unhappy. This is also related to the [[humans.paradoxical-theory-of-change]].\n\nPeople feel safer when there is more information in the environment (related to vulnerability). When someone is angry but it is left unsaid, threat goes up.\n\nBefore going into higher order work (emotions and relationships need to be taken care of first before learning), your primitive brain needs to be taken care of first.\n\n## 3 Types of Environment\n\n1. _Spacial environment_: seating arrangements, building layout etc. Asking 7 people to sit in an inner circle while everyone else forms an outer circle to observe them already causes members of the inner circle to feel unsafe. Other examples: financial environments, organization charts (who gets to talk to who).\n2. _Linguistic environment_: how we judge and assess one another. E.g, culture, policies, what is allowable or not.\n\n   There are many things we could observe linguistically that could make us feel unsafe, but they boil down to these [[humans.systems.linguistic-behaviours-from-lack-of-psychological-safety]]. These behaviours show up when people feel unsafe, which causes a new observer to feel unsafe as well.\n3. _Material environment_: material resource e.g food, sleep, exercise, salary.

When avoiding critique, the feeling that nothing moves (which comes from you intrapersonally) gets projected onto the system.\n\n   This comes from the mental script when in survival of not wanting to appear negative and a fear that others think you act with ill intent.\n2. _Don't show weakness_: causes you to feel misunderstood in the long run. If there is pain that is not known to the system, this is a natural outcome.\n\n   This comes from the mental script of not wanting to show weakness to be seen as contributing. \"Since everyone else also experiences pain, suck it up\".\n3. _Don't offer ideas_: causes you to feel insignificant in the long run. Every idea that comes in can be disruptive and break the status quo.\n\n   This is based on the fear of disrupting the system, \"don't want to be the one that shakes things up\" and appear disruptive.\n4. Don't ask questions: causes feelings of helplessness / being unable to affect change in the long run. Knowledge is the beginning of power. Without knowledge, you cannot affect change.\n\n   This comes from the mental script of \"Other people think I should have known.

We feel good about ourselves. We like what we experience within ourselves. We sense that we are reasonably whole.\n\n    How do we know that we are ok, with or without external input?\n- _Insecurity about Insecurity_: Low self-esteem and low self-worth are often referred to as selfdoubt or insecurity.\n    Having self-doubt is natural, but allowing ourselves to be trapped behind our own facade, hiding our own insecurity from ourselves and others without doing anything with them, that will affect our work.\n- _Blindness to One's Strengths_: Sometimes, by not owning our strengths, we can also be unaware of additional potential strengths within ourselves. By not attributing our success and competency to self, we cannot build on them.\n    We often can not accept praise/recognition in a straightforward way, e.g \"I am so glad you like that.\"\n    We might be readier to share our gaps and deficiencies than our strengths, but when people agree with us, we feel hurt.\n- _Discomfort with Intimacy_: How close can 1 let myself get to this other person?\n    Many factors can get into consultant's preference for or dislike of intimacy, knowing what the factors are can give us a better understanding of ourselves and our choices in our work with others.\n- _Anger_: In many cultures, the experience of anger within a person, and its expression or its control involve frequent challenges for all of us. Many of us are fearful of anger. We either surpassed or deflected our anger. By doing so, we can not come to the root cause of such powerful emotion and hence stop ourselves to gain greater insights on self and others.\n- _Tolerance for Ambiguity_: The need to be in control in the first instance, and the intolerance of ambiguity in the second both impel us toward meeting our own needs, rather than making it possible for the other party to be where they want to be.\n    Being unaware of our own needs, yet unconsciously being driven by them, can lead us to ineffective behaviour.\n    How comfortable are we with the complexity and ambiguity of client interactions?\n- _Awareness of One's Biases_: Seeing accurately is central to a consultant's effectiveness. Much of the work of consultants requires that we accurately perceive the data available to us so that we can act appropriately considering what the data tells us.\n    Data collection and diagnosis - whilst useful and necessary - still need interpretation by the consultant.

It comprises of morning large system check-ins, afternoon classes that give added distinction to support the T-Groups, and evening whole system check-outs, and then typically residential experience where the interaction continues without structure. All data is contributing to learning.\n2. _Training Groups / Sensitivity Groups / Therapy Groups (T-Groups)_: Depending on whether there is a therapist in group (if not they are called Training Groups or Sensitivity Groups), these are small groups systems that typically sits within a structure of a HI Lab. But can also be conducted separately. Sensitivity Groups (Its original name) began as emotional support groups that created a space for specifically men to get in touch with what is going on inside themselves and to work through their units of work. Later on, the model was experienced as very powerful and evolved to become T-Groups and therein non gender specific to extend the learning / training for all. The intention was to develop more facilitators to support the healing of others. Therein Training Groups (T-Groups). Typically T-Groups have no structure and are open learning containers that respond to only what emerges and doesn’t define a modality of learning.\n3. _Action Learning Sets_: In form, these look similar to T-Groups where it is a small group of (6-9) people that gather regularly to learn from each other with minimal intervention from a facilitator or container holder. But unlike T-Groups, action learning sets have ritual or process that provide structure in how each member of a group interact with each other. PSLs are action learning sets. Alcoholic Anonymous is also an Action Learning Set.\n4. _Action Learning Set (Organizational structure) / Community of practice_: This is similar to the above, except the members are typically from a similar sector, industry or shared profession or skill set. Members gather regularly to take turns in working through each other’s issues and problems. They may not necessarily be emotional. Organizations also use this for large systems, to allow for different parts of their typically siloed system to meet and hear from each other’s experience. The model focuses on one person in each set, where each member goes into the full support of that person to better empathize with what they are going through. Over time, taking turns to addressing needs from each person in a system allow for equilibrium to emerge eventually.\n5. _Action Research_: Action research is a process by which change and understanding can be pursued at the one time.  It is usually described as cyclic, with action and critical reflection taking place in turn.  The reflection is used to review the previous action and plan the next one. It is commonly done by a group of people, though sometimes individuals use it to improve their practice.  It has been used often in the field of education for this purpose.  It is not unusual for there to be someone from outside the team who acts as a facilitator.

What is our mission? Objective for the next 5 years? This is missing in Singapore.\n2. _Work_: build competencies, meaning and purpose\n3. _Safety_: when friction and conflict happens in the natural course of diversity, people will complain. The critical thing here is that it fixes nothing. As long as there are others who are also complaining, \"I am right and I feel safe\".\n\n   There is no maturity in this space - maturity comes from perspective. In the online space, these are echo chambers. We have a human need to go there. This is about fitting in.\n\n   E.g, lunch groups at the office\n4. _Healing / belonging_: in the space where safety is found, capabilities need to develop for healing. You can be who you are and belong anyways. If you can see me for who I am and take me anyways, I belong. Contrast this with fitting in above.\n5. _Power and Politics_: this happens after safety if healing does not take place. \"this sucks, want to challenge and change the system\". E.g racial politics. Leads to a desire to change aspirations. What happens when you feel you don't belong. Who gets to decide because this system is not serving me.\n\n   This is not necessarily bad, e.g water cooler conversations.\n\nThe first 2 are on the table, while the rest are typically [[under the table|humans.systems.marshaks-table]].\n\nThere're 2 ways that conversations could go:\n\n1. Aspiration ➡ work ➡ safety ➡ healing\n2. Aspiration ➡ work ➡ safety ➡ power and politics ➡ back to aspiration\n   - When there is safety, there is a tendency to not want to proceed with healing, which always comes with pain. Also requires skill in the system.\n\nExamples:\n\n- A child is not doing homework because the conversation to set up an aspiration that the child then owns is missing. Often, parents proceed to talk about work, skipping the aspiration conversation entirely.\n    This is equally applicable in the work setting - systems are dysfunctional because of lack of aspiration conversations, not due to the work being done. Some things could be assumed, not agreed on.\n- Racial politics and Trump's election campaign are examples of what happens when after safety, healing is not done and there's a desire to redefine aspirations.\n\nIntervening in these factors is done through the appropriate container.\n\n## Psychological Safety\n\nIf people feel unsafe in the system, setting containers for these conversations is one way of creating safety.\n\nFor example, a group of people feel unsafe in a healthcare system due to the disruption caused by covid19. One of the leaders created a smaller group and in that group, everyone committed to \"being there for each other\". Within that group, people could experience abundance and safety. It is fascinating how this linguistic act could cause such a profound change.\n","n":0.046}}},{"i":186,"$":{"0":{"v":"Psychological Safety Workshop","n":0.577},"1":{"v":"\n# Psychological Safety Workshop\n\nThese notes are from the Psychological Safety workshop (now [Power Dynamics and Psychological Safety](https://thethoughtcollective.arlo.co/w/courses/14-power-dynamics-and-psychological-safety)) by The Thought Collective taken on 12 Nov 2020.\n\nUnlike [[humans.fpc2]], this is only a 1 day workshop which assumes no familiarity with FPC material.\n\nBecause psychological safety is related to system work, most of the content introduced overlapped with FPC 2.

This involves changes in an aspect of personality or behaviour. E.g, being better with people, being able to present or facilitate conversations better.\n\nSometimes I succeed, but more often than not I didn't. This was like trying to change into someone that I was not.\n\nAfter I stopped trying so hard to change and as I've done more self-work, I've found it easier to move from the fitting in to the belonging end of the spectrum.

Each of these 3 elements overlap with one another. There is a point in the centre which is where all 3 elements overlap.](../assets/images/observer.jpg)\n\nIn the body-emotions-language (BEL) model in ontological coaching, our way of being consists of 3 interconnected elements:\n\n* [[humans.body]]: how we move through space, posture, health\n* [[humans.emotions]]: the emotions and moods which are predispositions to action\n* [[humans.language]]: what we say, our external and internal conversations and stories. Two people could have similar biologies but see the world very differently due to language\n\nThough we can talk about each element of the BEL separately, they are interconnected and congruent. For example, try slumping forward and saying \"I had such a great day\". The body does not match or is not congruent to what is being said.\n\nBecause of this congruency, each of the elements of the BEL could be used as doorways to design change into the others. For example, exercise makes you feel better (emotions) which would change how what you think and say (language). We can invent new conversations to affect how we feel over time. We can listen to music to change how we feel, our posture and what we say.\n\nWe are not detached observers. We are very concerned observers because we want certain results in our lives. The world doesn't have problems. Problems and solutions are a function of the observer.\n\nWe always act consistently with the observer that we are. This means that the actions being taken and the results being achieved can be used to understand how we observe.\n","n":0.056}}},{"i":190,"$":{"0":{"v":"Observer-Actions-Results Model","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"\n# Observer-Action-Results Model\n\nThe Observer-Action-Results (OAR) model is at the heart of ontological coaching.\n\n## First-order Learning\n\nEach of us take action (speaking or physical actions) to get results (effectiveness, mood, context, public identity, etc). If the desired result is achieved, you might repeat the same action. If the results are not satisfactory, you might look at what other actions you could try in hopes of getting the results you want.\n\nThis is first order learning and is something that is traditionally taught.\n\n![An illustration of first order learning described above](../assets/images/first%20order%20learning.jpg)\n\nThis implies that there is an objective problem that exists and the right action is needed to solve them.\n\n## Second Order Learning\n\nThere is a more powerful form of learning available.\n\nInstead of looking at possible actions to try to get a desired result, you can look at yourself to observe how you observe. Change how you observe and you can see new actions or possibilities that you could not before.\n\nThe way each person observes the world determines the set of possible actions available or visible to them. If you can understand how you observe the world, you can consciously choose to observe in a different way to see new possibilities.\n\nSeeing more possibilities for action provides choice because it allows you to choose whether to take any of these actions or not. If you can't see it as a possibility, the choice to take an action is simply not available.\n\nEach of us is a unique observer of our surroundings, and no two people will see the world in the same way. Have you ever struggled with a problem that was solved after a 5 minute conversation with someone else?\n\n![An illustration of second order learning described above](../assets/images/second%20order%20learning.jpg)\n\nFor example, if I am working and want to earn more money, the actions that I see are: getting promoted or finding a different job. Someone else might see these same 2 possible actions but they may add one more: \"setting up your own business\".\nWhat is it about my way of being such that setting up a business isn't even on the radar screen of possibilities?\nA possible answer is that I see the world as a place full of dangers, while the other person sees the world as a place full of opportunities. This is a belief about the world that lives in language.\n\n### Way Of Being\n\nYou may take many different actions to achieve different results.\n\nHowever, all the actions you take ultimately come from the same observer (yourself) - the same way of seeing things, the same perspective.\n\nLooking at how each of us observes takes us closer to an exploration about who we say we are and \"be\",, less about any particular thing you're doing. Here are some different ways of seeing the world - operating from different orientations will result in different sets of actions being available:\n\n* \"I am enough\" vs \"I am not enough\"\n* \"The world is full of danger\" vs \"The world is full of opportunities\"\n* \"I am whole\" vs \"I am not whole / flawed\"\n* [[Be-do-have vs have-do-be|humans.be-do-have]]\n\nWe observe the world through distinctions. Distinctions make us aware of things that stand out. E.g, a software engineer is able to get more information from a piece of code than someone who does not code.\nTeaching someone your job is about teaching them the distinctions that you've acquired.\n\nWhat distinctions are worth learning to become a more powerful observer? Powerful in this sense is the capacity for taking more effective action.\n\nAn answer provided by ontological coaching is distinctions to understand our [[way of being |humans.observer]] - what it means to be human.\nThese distinctions help us understand \"why do I observe things in the way that I do\". Hence, second-order learning considers our way of being.\n","n":0.04}}},{"i":191,"$":{"0":{"v":"Mastery","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n# Mastery\n\nMastery over a domain is not reserved for the selected few with the right genetics. It is something that anyone can attain with enough effort.\n\nLearning any new skill involves making some progress, followed by a slight decline to a plateau (usually higher than the previous plateau). Most of the time will be spent on a plateau, practicing even when it seems to be going nowhere.\n\n## Taking Shortcuts\n\nThe master's journey is long and rocky, so we sometimes look for other paths.\n\nThese categorizations aren't always as neat as described. Even in the same field, you can sometimes be on the path to mastery, at other times an obsessive.\n\n### The Dabbler\n\nThe dabbler is very enthusiastic with starting the new career, learning the new sport or starting a new relationship. The dabbler enjoys the rituals of getting started: the new equipment, the shine of newness. He or she is overjoyed with the initial progress, e.g showing off in a new sport to friends.\n\nThe fall from the first peak and the plateau that follows is unacceptable. The dabbler starts making excuses about why the skill isn't right (e.g, the sport is too competitive / not right etc) and starts missing lessons and telling everyone else the excuses.\n\nStarting something new is an opportunity to replay that scenario.\n\nIn careers, the dabbler has a lengthy resume. In relationships, the dabbler specializes in honeymoons.\n\n### The Obsessive\n\nTo the obsessive, quick results are what matters and it doesn't matter how he or she gets them. The obsessive wants to perfect the stroke after the first class, stays after class to talk to the instructor and gets books to help learn the skill more quickly.\n\nThe obsessive makes good progress at first, but the inevitable plateau is unacceptable. He or she puts in even more effort and takes shortcuts to get quick results, or does all nighters. The burnout leads to a sharp decline and a jagged fall, hurting not just the obsessive about others around them in the process.\n\n### The Hacker\n\nThe hacker doesn't mind skipping stages needed to develop mastery. After making some initial progress, the hacker doesn't mind staying on a plateau indefinitely. The hacker is the employee that doesn't develop professionally, does just enough to get by and wonders why he or she isn't getting promoted.\n","n":0.052}}},{"i":192,"$":{"0":{"v":"Notes for Mastery by George Leonard","n":0.408},"1":{"v":"\n# Mastery\n\n1.

For example, would you trust someone who has read many books about how to fly an airplane over someone who has actually flown planes before?\n\n## Enemies Of Learning\n\nMany of these barriers to learning live in [[humans.language]].\n\n* Inability to admit \"I don’t know\": saying already know declares a context which learning is very unlikely. How much learning takes place when teaching someone who says they already know? Also connected to the mood of arrogance, coming from the belief that those around us have nothing new to teach.\n    \n    * Paradoxically, I've found that you tend to be good at something when you can readily admit to not knowing, because that sets the context for learning.\n    \n* When you don’t know that you don’t know, but you act as if you do: when you don't know that you don't know, you don't acknowledge the blind spot\n* Being unaware that we live in blindness (arrogance): not acknowledging that each of us brings perspectives and capabilities that are unique. There's no way to know of the unique aspects of everyone else\n* \"I should already know\": common in organizations when you move up the ladder or as you get older\n* \"I have to be clear about everything, all the time\": this is the barrier to taking action. Sometimes the answers come once you start taking action, but if you never do so till you're 100% certain, you may never take action and learn\n* Forgetting the domain of emotions and its impact on learning: emotions like anger and resentment makes learning much more unlikely\n* Distrust: not trusting the teacher so that the student will take action even though they don't fully understand why yet. If the new action is not taken, there is no practice so learning doesn't occur\n* Confusing \"knowing\" with having opinions or information: knowing means the capacity for certain action (like flying a plane) vs opinions which don't give you the same capability\n* Addiction to novelty: prevents accumulation of enough time and practice for the learning to occur\n* Addiction to answers\n* Not granting permission to be taught: connected to distrust or arrogance\n* Making everything overly significant\n* Making everything trivial\n* Living in permanent assessments or judgments\n* Living in the belief \"I cannot learn, given who I am\": if I saw that I am not a math person, I am very unlikely to ever take new action to learn math. The belief sets a context where I am unlikely to take new action. Since learning = time + practice, I will produce no new results in math. If you say \"See, I told you I'm not good at math\", this is due to the belief that came first, then the result.

We're sincere in what we're asking for\n2. We declare satisfaction when what has been asked for, has been delivered\n\n## Elements Of An Effective Request / Offer\n\nWe make requests all the time. Some requests are more effective - likely to be accepted and lead to better understanding while others breed resentment and misunderstanding. These 6 elements can be helpful for making better requests and listening to requests from others.\n\n1. _Committed speaker_: the speaker puts their body into the request and takes actions to have a committed listener. E.g, making an anonymous request or making a request over your shoulder when passing by someone are not effective.\n2. _Committed listener_: a committed listener is someone who is not otherwise distracted and engaged in doing something else and is giving you their full attention.\n3. _Future actions and condition of satisfaction_: share what you want the listener to do (future action) and the standards that you want the listener to apply while doing it (conditions of satisfaction). Often, what's obvious to one person isn't obvious to another.\n\n   Common reasons why conditions of satisfaction are not spelt out are fear of insulting the listener's intelligence, assuming they already know these details or not having enough time to go into details.\n\n   2 powerful acts to try when concerned about insulting the other person (also useful in other situations) are:\n\n   - Speak directly into your concern about not wanting to insult the other person’s intelligence\n   - Declare yourself a beginner at having the conversation in this way\n\n   For example, \"I’m not entirely sure how to proceed here so let me just share with you what’s going on with me. I want to be specific in requesting your involvement in X, but I have a concern that the way I’m going to ask it is going to insult your intelligence, and that’s not at all what I want. This project is new for me, I haven’t had too many conversations like this, and I really want us to be on the same page with it. Are you okay with me being specific here, even in areas where it may seem obvious, so that we can make doubly sure we’re understanding this in the same way? As uncomfortable as it may be, I think it’ll end up giving us a lot better starting point for moving forward and avoiding misunderstandings later on\"\n\n   Being more precise will be helpful at the beginning of a relationship. As it progresses and a shared background of obviousness is developed, requests can be less detailed.\n\n   Some other reasons for making vague requests are fear of rejection and feeling as if you lack the authority or deserve to make that request. This leads to vague requests with room for interpretation.\n\n   In long-term relationships, you may be able to communicate much with few words due to the shared background of obviousness. But always keep in mind the possibility of being misinterpreted.\n4. _Timeframe_: specify if there is a time the request should be completed by. Sometimes the background of obviousness may fill this in.\n\n   Commonly used terms like \"as soon as possible\", \"promptly\" or \"when you get the chance\" are not effective because there is room for interpretation.\n5. _Mood of the request / offer_: the emotional space of the speaker and listener. The mood of the listener influence how they interpret and respond and the mood of the speaker influences how the request is made.\n\n   > The right conversation in the wrong mood is the wrong conversation.\n6. _Context_: informing the listener of background to understand the request and how it fits into a bigger picture.\n\n## Offers\n\nThe above applies to offers too. Offers are different from requests because they are connected to career and businesses in ways that requests are not.\n\nOffers are made to address some concern. E.g, a business is an ongoing offer to the public which addresses some concern customers have.\n\nQuestions to ponder:\n\n* What is your professional offer to the world? In this lens, a resume is a list of assertions while an offer letter speaks to someone's concerns.\n* Not counting all your acalades, qualifications or experiences, what do you offer to the world? I.e, what would be missing if you were no longer around?\n\n## Not Requesting Because \"it should be obvious\"\n\nProfessionally and personally, we may be in situations when we don't make a request because \"I shouldn't have to ask you that\" because the other person should already know or this is just common sense.\n\nThis is an example of the choice to be right vs being happy. From a position of right-ness where we shouldn't have to ask you to do that, not making request does not lead to the desired result. This causes resentment and we continue to find fault with the other person. Or we can make the request to produce the desired result and operate from the work / doesn't work orientation and find some degree of happiness.\n","n":0.033}}},{"i":197,"$":{"0":{"v":"Promises","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n# Promises\n\nThe fabric of society and the economy is held together by promises (AKA agreements or commitments) between individuals and organizations. E.g, an employer promising to pay someone for work done.\n\nThe [[effectiveness of the request|humans.language.requests-and-offers]] affects how clear both parties are about what exactly has been promised. Ineffective requests could cause both parties to have different interpretations about what exactly has been promised.\n\nPromises change the world the instant they are made, not just by their fulfillment. The other person makes different choices because of the promise. Language communicates commitment, not just information.\n\nWhen keeping or breaking a promise, it affects:\n\n- Trust\n- Relationships\n- Success\n- Self-esteem\n\nWhen keeping a promise, all of these elements go up (or down when breaking a promise) for the parties at both ends.\n\nHow well you manage your commitments has a huge impact on public identity.\n\n## Angle Of Inauthenticity\n\nThe angle of authenticity (i.e, the BS angle) is the difference between:\n\n- What I say I will do, what I say I will say\n- What I actually do, what I actually say\n\nIn this analogy, whether we keep our promises is the amount of bullshit we're producing. People have good BS detectors.\n\n## Types Of Promises\n\n1. _Strong promises_: promises that you're committed to keeping. You can count on me.\n2. _Shallow promise_: like strong promises, but with an unsaid \"unless x or y happens\". There is a private out for ourselves that the other person doesn't know.\n3. _Criminal promises_: promises we have no intention of keeping at the moment when they are made.\n\nAs an exercise, think about the various types of promises you make in various domains (work, friends and to yourself).\n\nLow self-esteem is closely related to promises. We often make criminal promises to ourselves. The broken promises live on in us, which affects moods and results.\n\n## Managing Commitments\n\nNo one is perfect, so there will be situations where you can't keep a promise made in good faith due to e.g circumstances out of your control.\n\nManaging these commitments by letting the other person know that you can't keep it as soon as possible lets them make alternate arrangements or renegotiate the promise. Not managing this well has obvious effects on the relationship and your public identity.\n\nWe can't keep every promise we make, but can take responsibility to manage all of them.\n\nSingle promises are often linked with other promises. Your ability to deliver on a promise might depend on someone else keeping their promise to you. Likewise, the other party being able to deliver promises to others depends on you keeping your promise.\n\nCommitments are also not made in isolation - often on top of existing commitments. The other person doesn't know about the 20 other commitments you're juggling, just that you made a promise to them.\n\nThis causes people to be overwhelmed. Time management books try to address this but improvements are often not sustained in the long term.\n\nThere is no such thing as time management: time doesn't stop. We can management commitments, not time.\n\n[[Saying no|humans.language.declarations]] is extremely important to manage commitments to avoid others running your life. It may not be easy, but it is worth it.\n\n### Requests Vs Demands In Organizations\n\nIn organizations, there will be legitimate situations where saying no is not an option. This would be a demand. Being employed means you agree to say yes in such situations.\n\nHowever, there is a boundary between these requirements and requests. Its often the case where the person making the request views them as requests while the other party views them as demands with no room for declining or negotiation.\n\nIt may be useful to have a conversation to clarify what are requests vs demands.\n\n### Responsible Complaints\n\nNot dealing with broken promises usually leads to resentment, decline in the relationship and less productivity and effectiveness when working together. To manage an unfulfilled promise when you're on the receiving end, initiate a responsible complaint.\n\nA responsible complaint is a conversation where the recipient of the broken promise initiates a conversation with the other party[^1] to take care of the broken promise in a way that maintains or even strengthens the relationship.\n\nResponsible complaints are only applicable when there has been a broken promise, not when someone doesn't meet an (usually unspoken) expectation.\n\nPromises unkept are NOT equal to expectations unmet.\n\nStart by having a conversation about responsible complaints - where people working together discuss commitments and managing commitments, as well as the negative consequences of having promises go unkept and unmanaged. Participants in this conversation give each other permission to call each other on unmet commitments. Share concerns with being beginners and not \"getting it right\" and \"hurting feelings\" which are valid concerns. This sets the context in which a responsible complaint has the best chance of success.\n\nTo make a responsible complaint:\n\n1. Start with assertions. Clarify with the other person whether the promise existed in the first place, and whether the promise did or did not get fulfilled.\n2. If the promise was made and has indeed not been kept, declare the unacceptability of this happening again. Share assessments of negative consequences that occurred. Request that promises in the future are managed by doing X or Y.\n3. Make a new request with a new time frame and obtain a promise to take care of what needed to be taken care of.\n\n### Responding To Requests\n\nWhen trying to create a culture of commitment and personal ownership and responsibility for managing promises, these responses to requests are not effective:\n\n- I'll try\n- Maybe / possibly / perhaps / we'll see\n- Silence (no response)\n\nInstead, the conversation should end with one of these 4 responses to a request:\n\n- _Yes_: acceptance, so we have a promise\n- _No_: decline, so we don't have a promise\n- _Commit to commit_: a promise to get back to the requester at a specified time with an answer\n- _Counter-offer_: a decline of the initial request with its conditions and an offer to accept if some conditions are changed. \"I can't get it done by Fri, would Mon work?\"\n\nThese responses are all clear and not fuzzy. Its a clean interaction where everyone knows what's going to happen.\n\n## Commitments In Organizations\n\nOrganizations can be viewed as a web of promises - nested cycles of commitment which are connected to one another.\n\nIn an organization where promises are not met and allowed to slide, unspoken assumptions and responsibility not being taken to manage commitments, there is lots of blaming others and excuses about why things are not done.\n\nIn an organization where commitments are made publicly and most people manage their commitments and take them seriously, there is much less unexpected drops of the ball as people are often communicating with others and renegotiating commitments. Everyone expects commitments to be kept and managed. Anyone failing to manage a commitment will be called out on it by peers or subordinates not in a accusing way, but one consistent with a culture of trust, responsibility and teamwork. This is agreed upon in advance.\n\n---\n\n[^1]: I've observed that the person which broke a promise to us is often the last person that we talk to. Instead, we complain to anyone else behind their backs, which is often unproductive.\n","n":0.029}}},{"i":198,"$":{"0":{"v":"Listening","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n# Listening\n\n> We say what we say, but they listen what they listen. And in between is the black hole that swallows relationships, money, time and love.\n\n> For us, listening is the touchstone of all language phenomena. Speech, being a primarily social phenomenon, is validated in the listening that we obtain against what we say. It is listening that determines the effectiveness of speech and, therefore, one of the skills that the speaker must develop is to take responsibility for listening to the other. In the same way, we also have to take responsibility for listening to others.\n>\n> The concept of conversational skills allowed us, therefore, to include listening skills. However, it was necessary to go even further. Human beings not only listen to what I tell others, we also hear the silence. We interpret what this can mean and we know, for example, that silence can be even more eloquent than words.\n>\n> With the distinction of conversational skills we were winning everywhere.\"\n>\n> -Rafael Echeverría, The Distinction of Conversational Competencies\n\nHearing is different from listening - listening is where meaning is made. 10 people can hear the same thing but listen in 10 different ways because each person is a unique [[humans.observer]].\n\nWe all want to be listened to and to be understood. Deep listening is a skill that is universally useful.\n\nDeep listening requires awareness of your internal state (body, emotions and internal thoughts) as well as being aware of the BEL of the speaker.\n\n- Self-management: build awareness so you are aware of whether you're caught up in your own thoughts, distracted, coming up with a response, or your own story about what the speaker is saying\n- Being present: reschedule the conversation or decline it if you are not able to be fully present (e.g, distracted with other work)\n- Notice the BEL of the speaker: \"its fine\" while appearing stressed / uncomfortable\n- Listen for [[humans.content-and-context]]\n- Listen for care. Listening for an agenda misses what the speaker cares about, so the response does not address the speaker's concern\n- Ask questions:\n  1. Clarifying questions to get more facts\n  2. Questions to find out what the speaker care about, getting to know the human being on the other side\n\n## Filters, Discourses and Biases\n\nOur discourse is our way of Communication. E.g, your beliefs, the way you move, how you speak.\n\nA bias is a prejudice in favour or against something. This is not necessarily negative. E.g, a bias to eat healthily, being vegetarian.\n\nA filter is a particular way of seeing the world. E.g, how you see money - spend it now to do things while you still can vs saving it for bigger purchases later.\n\nBias or filters will affect how you listen and could cause blind spots. Listening well requires self-work to become aware of these things.\n\nBesides being aware of your own biases / discourses / filters, also listen out for those of the speaker.\n","n":0.046}}},{"i":199,"$":{"0":{"v":"Declarations","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n# Declarations\n\nWith [[humans.language.assertions]], first comes the world, then the word. With declarations, the word comes first, and the world follows.\n\nDeclarations are a speech act where the speaker creates new possibilities and a new way of seeing things from nothingness. They don't depend on the existing world but bring a new world into existence. Declarations generate our reality. E.g, my reality is \"I had a bad day\".\n\nDeclarations are also highly connected to moods and emotions. E.g, the PM of Singapore declaring that \"Singapore is behind all foreign workers\" would have been political suicide usually, but the declaration landed very well during Covid19. Leaders may need to wait for the appropriate time for the right mood / emotion so that their declaration lands.\n\nMoods influence the types of declarations that you're likely to make. The connection goes both ways: making new declarations can also shift your mood.\n\nWe take 4 primary actions with declarations:\n\n1. _Open or initiate_: e.g declaring a country into being, creating a new organization, initiating a new relationship by introducing yourself, \"i don't know\" opens a space for learning to happen, \"I'm grateful for\" makes joy and contentment possible, \"this isnt working\" declares a breakdown\n2. _Close or conclude_: an apology closes a chapter and opens a new one, \"I forgive you\" concludes an event and closes the accompanying resentment. \"Thank you\" declares satisfaction with your fulfillment of a promise to me, \"You're fired\", \"this relationship is over\"\n3. _Resolve_: judgments from a judge or jury resolves questions of guilt or innocence (regardless of what actually happened), yes/no (every decision is a declaration)\n4. _Evaluate (with assessments)_: [[humans.language.assessments]] are a type of declaration.\n\nDeclarations can be valid or invalid. Whether it is valid depends on whether the person making the declaration has authority granted by the community to do so. E.g, a priest declaring someone married changes the world in a way that a random person on the street going through the same motions cannot.\n\nSocially, the expectations around declarations are:\n\n1. The speaker does have the authority to make that declaration (i.e, [[humans.systems.power]] and [[humans.trust]])\n2. The speaker acts in a way consistent with their declaration\n\nMaking declarations when you lack the authority to make them generates a public identity of \"loony\" or out of it. Likewise, not acting consistently with your declarations generates the public identity of a hypocrite.\n\n## Declarations Create Context\n\nContext is that that surrounds the text, or the environment against which something is interpreted.\n\nDeclarations create [[context|humans.content-and-context]] which affects how future events are interpreted. E.g watching TV at 10PM (the content / event / fact) after your parents created context by declaring \"no more TV after 9PM\" causes that event to be interpreted differently.\n\nIt is powerful to notice and do this consciously.\n\nCreating the right context is also critical for leadership. When declarations create this nonphysical environment, this environment is the mood or culture of a relationship, family, organization or nation. Hence, successful leadership requires creating and sustaining a certain context (and not another).\n\nSuccessful relationships are built on conversations where we share our views, come to mutual understanding and make mutual declarations about we we're committed to bring forth and how we're committed to be with each other.\n\nConversations for setting and sharing contexts are often missing in personal and professional situations.\n\n## Key Declarations\n\n### Yes and No\n\nSaying yes commits you to an action, opening new possibilities and closing others. Likewise with saying no.\n\nEvery decision is a declaration.\n\nSaying no can often be difficult, because we often equate no with rejection of the other person. Likewise, others saying no to you is often seen as a rejection of you.\n\nThe inability to say no is connected to our power and dignity. This is an example where not being able to say a certain thing (\"No\") = not being able to be a certain way (assertive, designing my life, with dignity).\n\nNot being able to say no likely leads to being overcommitted (committing to do doing 10 things when you've already agreed to do 15 other tasks). This leads to feeling overwhelmed and stressed.\n\nA more powerful interpretation to adopt is saying no is simply declining a request - the person and the request are separate. Saying no is just declining of the request, not a rejection of the other person.\n\n### I Don't know\n\nI don't know is often interpreted as I am stupid / don't care / don't want to know etc.\n\nAnother interpretation is that I'm available for [[humans.learning]]. Ignorance is not the opposite of learning, it is where learning starts.\n\nI don't know creates a new context for learning. How much learning happens when teaching someone who already thought they knew it?\n\nConversations about learning could be missing - granting ourselves and others to be a beginner at something and how to bring learning about.\n\n### I apologize\n\nLinguistically takes care of a relationship by acknowledging mistakes and broken commitments. It closes a chapter and opens a new one and heals the relationship.\n\nWhen promises have not been kept and no apologies are issued, that has an effect on the relationship moving forward. E.g, leaders in organizations who do this create a mood of resentment and cynicism.\n\nEveryone makes mistakes, so this declaration can surely serve us personally and professionally.\n\n### I Forgive You\n\nSee [[humans.language.declarations.forgiveness]].\n\n### Thank you\n\nThank you is an acknowledgement of another's kindness or contribution. Can be seen as a declaration of acceptance that closes a transaction (usually a promise or an agreement)\n\nThank you can also greatly influence mood. The mood of joy is connected to the mood of gratitude. E.g, try imagining someone who is joyful not being grateful for something.\n\nHence, we can consciously move towards joy by learning how to declare [[humans.language.declarations.gratitude]].\n\n### I Love You\n\n> One of the most interesting ways of looking at love that I’ve ever heard is from Humberto Maturana, the pioneering Chilean neurobiologist. His definition of love is: The radical acceptance of the other as a legitimate other in co-existence with me.\n>\n> The focus is on our declaration of acceptance and of legitimacy. We declare our acceptance of another human being as being “legitimate” in his or her co-existence with us. To me, the words “true and equal partner” come to mind. Think about the implications of such a declaration. Declaring such a context, to me, immediately brings about a space of mutual respect and acceptance. It also allows space for us to make requests of each other, and maintain flexibility and openness in designing how we do what we do together.\n\nConsider a relationship where \"I love you\" is never said. Thinking it is very different from saying it. Saying it builds the relationship and sets context.\n\nWho are the loved ones in your life who you've not said this to? Why not?\n\n### I Am ...\n\nThis is a declaration of who we say are in the world (our identity). This is a primary declaration and is at the heart of ontological coaching.\n\nA lot of suffering is caused by operating out of primary declarations that aren't conducive to the actions and moods needed to achieving the results we want.\n\nThese root declarations are usually invisible and hard to see. We see ourselves repeating the same mistakes over and over again. This is where a coach comes in and helps the coachee see these underlying interpretations for what they are (not the truth) and how that influences their actions. The coachee can then invent and declare new ones.\n\nFor example, \"I am shy\". If this is viewed as a permanent fixture of who you are, then change is unlikely. For example, at a dance it is unlikely someone who says they're shy would ask someone for a dance. If the declaration is held as the truth, it paralyzes and limits possibilities for designing something different.\n\nBut if shy is viewed as an assessment and you declare yourself a beginner at dancing, you can learn and through practice, build competence.\n\nWe tend to make up stories which disempowers us.\n\n### This Is Not Working...\n\nSee [[humans.language.breakdowns]]\n","n":0.028}}},{"i":200,"$":{"0":{"v":"Gratitude","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n# Gratitude\n\nDeclaring gratitude is connected to joy and peace.\n\nTODO: expand on this more\n\n## Practicing Gratitude\n\nHere are some things I've learned about practicing gratitude.\n\n1. I suggest starting first by writing down something you're grateful for each day.\n\n   Its true that you can declare gratitude about anything, but doing so risks making the exercise feel mechanical especially when first learning how to practice gratitude.\n\n   Instead, wait for the thing you feel grateful for to come to you. You'll know if its right when you resonate with it.\n2. We tend to think about all the things that we are not happy about and wish to change. And it feels as if the list of things that we can be grateful for is dwarfed by all the things we are unhappy about.\n\n   But I realized there really is also an equally long list of things that we can be grateful for.\n\n   The list of things we dislike and want to change just seems a lot longer because that's what we've practiced noticing.\n\n   Hence, the practice of gratitude is about learning how to recognize what we already have and will receive, to learn how to make new assessments.\n\n   Gratitude really is a choice.\n3. The real test is to practice gratitude even in situations that seem incompatible with feeling grateful.\n\n   For example, I feel grateful for my anger at xyz because it allows me to recognize when my boundaries have been violated. I am grateful for sadness, which stands witness and shows me what I've lost.\n4. Gratitude doesn't make \"difficult\" emotions go away.

This powerful language act – the declaring of forgiveness – is central to our ability to close previous chapters and begin new ones. It may be the most powerful language act available to those of us seeking the experience of happiness, the experience of peacefulness in our lives.\n\nForgiveness is a powerful [[declaration|humans.language.declarations]] which lets a chapter close and another one open. In this context, the other person may not know / need to know about the declaration of forgiveness.\n\nHere, forgiveness is not for the other person. It is for the one who is suffering.\n\nForgiveness is a declaration in which we say:\n\n1. What you have done to me caused me harm and damaged my possibilities.\n2. I do not condone this, and I do not give you permission to do this again.\n3. I choose to forgive you, to let go of these conversations. I now will focus my attention and my awareness in other areas, rather than continuing to live in these conversations about you and about what you did. I choose to move forward with my life.\n4. I revoke my promise to somehow, some way, get you back.\n5. I choose to move into some peace and out of this resentment.\n\nForgiveness is a choice. However, you can't declare to never remember something. However, you can choose how you respond when you do remember.\n\nForgiveness can also bring dignity, self-worth and self-acceptance.\n\n## Barriers To Forgiveness\n\n- I'm right\n- They don't deserve to be forgiven\n- To forgive is to condone what they did\n- Forgiveness is a sign of weakness\n- To forgive means I'll forget, and I'll never forget\n- I want them to suffer, so I'll never forgive\n- Forgiving lets them off the hook\n\nThe focus is not on whether these interpretations are right or wrong, but on the actions and results they lead - that forgiveness will likely not occur, so the benefits of forgiveness are not available too.\n\n## Pain And Suffering\n\n> pain is biological, but suffering is linguistic.\n>\n> I don’t need to have pain in order to suffer, and I can have pain without the suffering. Forgiveness deals directly with the suffering. The single most powerful tool that I have discovered for designing well-being in my life is the declaration of forgiveness. It applies to my work and social life as well as my home life. A great many people in our workshops report the exact same thing.\n\n## When Forgiveness Is Premature\n\nIn some settings, people are encouraged to forgive without being truly ready for it.\n\nWhen forgiveness is premature, the underlying pain is often not dealt with, causing a split with the part of the self that still carries that pain. This pain will resurface eventually.\n\nInstead, it is healthier to allow the pain to carry us to forgiveness once we've worked our way through it.\n\n---\n\nQuotes and most of the content here are from Language and the Pursuit of Happiness.\n","n":0.045}}},{"i":202,"$":{"0":{"v":"Breakdowns","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n# Breakdowns\n\nMany things we do in life are transparent to us and we take action without thinking about it. For example, our attention is on the contents of a letter we're typing, not on the act of typing on the keyboard itself. We think about other things on the drive back home, not on the mechanics of driving.\n\n> Here’s a great way to understand whether or not a breakdown has occurred: If you hear yourself suddenly say “oh shit,” rest assured that in almost every case, a breakdown is present! Not all breakdowns begin with such a salute, but many do.\n\nBreaks in transparency (breakdowns or breaks for short) occur when an [[Assessment|humans.language.assessments]] is made that what's happening doesn't match with what is expected (i.e, it changes the normal course of events). For example, when typing isn't working, it is something you become aware of as it could affect your ability to submit a proposal in time, and you think about how to fix it.\n\nBreakdowns are neither good nor bad, just the break in the flow of things. It is how we observe and navigate them that determines what is possible. Ontological coaching is about navigating breakdowns. The break in transparency is a moment of choice, to consciously choose how to proceed towards the desired result.\n\n- The universe doesn't have breakdowns, people do. Different observers have different breakdowns. A huge breakdown by one person may pass unnoticed by another due to each having different distinctions.\n- Breakdowns just are - they are not good or bad.\n- They are assessed as positive if they provide more possibilities for action (e.g, a promotion) or negative if it closes possibilities (e.g, loss of a job).\n- Some life events are breaks that live in our communities and cultures and we don't have to declare them (e.g death, divorce). We experience them in the way defined by the culture. Not all cultures define these events as breaks, or give them the same positive or negative value.\n- Breakdowns may happen to us in the form of external events beyond our control, or we can [[declare|humans.language.declarations]] breakdowns into being.\n- When we say something is very difficult or terrible, we are saying that given the observer we are, the situation is difficult to handle or terrible to accept. Every declaration of a break in transparency observes the observer we are.\n- We can declare the status quo to be a breakdown. In organizations, this depends on the type of breakdown and our authority. We can declare any aspect of our personal lives a breakdown, which is often the first step for change or learning. Without declaring desatisfaction with the current state of events, there is no chance of initiating a process of growth and development.\n- Declaring a breakdown sets a new [[context|humans.content-and-context]] for action.\n- Breakdowns are inevitable, the point is not to avoid them. it is to gain competency and ability to deal effectively with the breakdowns which occur, as well as to gain practice in declaring breakdowns proactively as a way of moving ourselves toward the results we say we want.\n\n## Breakdowns And Coaching\n\nCoaching occurs only when there is a breakdown that the coachee declares. In ontological coaching, the breakdown is always in the observer, not the thing. E.g, the breakdown is not \"boss is a jerk\", its how the coachee / observer is looking at the situation.\n\nThe coach offers a conversation that allows the coachee to enlarge the observer that they are to take responsibility for the break they have declared. This is done by creating a context in which it becomes possible for the coachee to declare a breakdown. Some examples are contexts of lightness or intimacy. At all times the coachee should feel he/she is in a relationship of trust and respect with the coach.\n\n- The amount of discomfort caused by the break in transparency declared by the coachee correlates with the strength the coachee has to start the transformation process.\n- The nature of the break reveals the limits of the kind of observer the coachee is and what prevents them from taking action about the break.\n- Understanding the cultural context and discourses of the coachee provides the context to listen for the breakdown, and assess its importance.\n\n## Mastery In Living\n\nOur ability to deal with breaks is the mastery of living.\n\n* Competency is the ability to work in transparency for a scope of action.\n* On the other hand, mastery is the ability to deal with recurrent breaks in the same scope of action.\n","n":0.037}}},{"i":203,"$":{"0":{"v":"Assessments","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n# Assessments\n\n> Assertions have to do with what is so. Assessments have to do with what is possible.\n>\n> Julio Olalla\n\nAssessments are also [[humans.language.declarations]].\n\nAn assessment is a speech act where the speaker defines how he/she relates to the world or an event. For example, good vs bad, right vs wrong etc. The speaker takes a stand on something and comes to an judgement about something.\n\n- Assessments are highly generative and creative.\n- No third party may either prove an assessment true or false, as they are personal judgments from different observers out of different standards, beliefs, moods and experiences.\n- Assessments belong to the observer and not what is being observed. Assessments often reveal more about the observer and their standards than the subject being observed.\n    The room is spacious or cramped is an assessment that belongs to each individual observer, and not to the thing being observed. Whether a room is cramped or spacious depends on who's looking.\n- Assessments have everything to do with the future, and can be viewed as \"stepping stones\" toward the future. Whether positive or negative, assessments influence our interpretations and actions in the future. Sometimes this influence is minor, sometimes it is huge.\n    If you assess Bob as unreliable and there is an opening for your team, you will not choose Bob. The assessment of unreliable in the present influences the future choice to not select him. However, you could also make a different assessment - that Bob is reliable. This orients you towards choosing him for your team in the future instead.\n    \n    We tend to interpret in a way to make ourselves right. If you assess Bob as unreliable, what do you notice? Every time he's late, but not when he's on time (which gets written off as an exception).\n- We make assessments against standards which are often unspoken. E.g, Bob has been late 3 times leads to the assessment that Bob is unreliable, if the standard is say not being late more than twice. This assessment would affect whether Bob is chosen for a new team.\n    There is a social aspect to assessments. We adopt many of these standards through our upbringing or the community, often without consciously choosing to do so.\n    Standards are historical and can shift over time. E.g, what is considered old has changed in the past century due to medical advances.\n    There is nothing wrong about having different standards. However, standards are often hidden and not discussed, as such conversations are often missing. These conversations are powerful in both personal and professional relationships.\n- Assessments are highly influenced by moods and emotions. You will react differently to missing your bus when you are joyful vs frustrated.\n    This connection also goes the other way. If someone always makes assessments like \"that won't work\" or \"nothing will make a difference\", what mood is that person living in? Probably resignation or pessimism. The connection between mood and language shows up here in assessments. If you want to figure out the mood you're in or consciously design a different one, look at your assessments, particularly how you ground them or declare standards that you observe against to others.\n- We tend to assess ourselves based on our intentions, but others based on their behaviour.\n- Socially, we are expected to have some [grounds for making our assessments](#grounded-assessments) and are not just conjuring them from thin air.\n- Most people use the word opinions to describe assessments. The key difference between opinions and assessments in this context is assessments influence how we interpret future information, as we tend to only notice things that fit into our assessments so that we are right. For example, noticing every time someone is late, but not when they are on time.\n\nContrast this with [[humans.language.assertions]].\n\n## Assertions Vs Assessments\n\nIt is critical to make the distinction between assertions and assessments. This may sound obvious, but we often forget this and hold our assessments as the complete truth, especially regarding beliefs about ourselves. We often use them in the same way when thinking and speaking.\n\nPeople who live as if their assessments were assertions usually create a public identity of being stubborn, opinionated etc.\n\nAssessments may always be revised. This is very powerful when looking at assessments about ourselves that are not serving us in getting the results we say we want in our lives. Instead of viewing them through the right / wrong lens, do our assessments work / not work for us?\n\n## Who Do You Grant Authority To Assess You?\n\n- Who do you give the authority to assess you?\n- In what domains?\n\nIf you don't grant anyone authority to assess you in any domain, it shows up as not allowing anyone to share their authentic experience of you, which could be very valuable.\n\nIt does not have to be an all or nothing answer. Your boss may have the authority to assess you on your work performance, but not your choice of hobby.\n\nAssessments are never the truth, but can be useful. It could be one thing if 1 in 10 people said you're not performing; its another if this comes from 7 in 10 people.\n\nin personal situations we often give those closest to us great permission and latitude in assessing us, even in domains in which they may not be competent to do so. Thus, \"I love you and I give you permission to define who I am.\"\n\nBeing conscious about who you grant permission to assess you and in which domains can lead to more peace and less resentment in our lives.\n\n### Assessments From Authority Figures\n\nAssessments from authority figures are not just assessments - they are [[humans.language.declarations]]. We tend to ignore many positive assessments from others and focus from negative assessments from people in authority. Ground such assessments that you receive, and examine why the focus on only the negative assessments.\n\nAssessments from others belong to them. But once you take it into yourself, they become declarations because you have authority over your own life. When \"You’re not good enough\" becomes \"I am not good enough\", that's when the words have the most power over you.\n\nIf you're someone in authority, be careful with your assessments.\n\n## Master Assessments\n\nMaster assessments are root assessments that can spawn many other assessments.\n\nSome of the most common ones are:\n\n* \"I'm not good enough\"\n* \"I should ...\"\n* people pleaser\n* The opposite of not being enough: \"I am better than ...\"\n\nExamine these more closely by grounding these assessments.\n\n## Grounded Assessments\n\nWe are assessment machines and assess all the time. This is not inherently bad, it just is.\n\nAssessments show up everywhere in our lives. Assessments can be grounded or ungrounded. Being better at producing more grounded assessments - assessments consciously connected to facts, behaviours and standards - allows us design the lives we want.\n\n1. Clarify to yourself why you're making the assessment, for the sake of what? E.g, for some future or interaction. If there isn't a reason, then this is a recreational assessment that can't be grounded. \n    \n    We can have recreational assessments and there's nothing wrong with that, just that they're ungroundable. Recreational assessments tend to be more negative. The key is to notice them.\n2. Clarify the standards you're using in the assessment. Requires consciously noticing the standards that you set. If you assess someone as unreliable, what is the standard you have for reliability against which you're judging that person?\n3. Come up with actions or events (assertions) to support the assessment. Is this first-hand information? Be careful about using assessments to ground other assessments - you can't use being sloppy to ground the assessment of being unreliable.\n    We often borrow assessments of people we've never even met from others and use that to make other assessments.\n4. Come up with assertions that support the opposite assessment. If so, what does this mean?\n5. Ground the assessment with other people, especially the way that you connected assertions to assessment. This is not about trying to get others to agree with you. Maintain a mode of openness and inquiry in this conversation, as this can be one way to build trust and lay a foundation for solid relationships. It can also be an excellent source of feedback about the effectiveness and consequences of using our current standards.\n\n## Do I Need To Assess This?\n\nThis is a useful question for looking at your own assessments: ask yourself \"when assessing, do I need to assess this?\".\n\nThis can reduce the recreational assessments that you make, which can lead to more peace in our lives.\n\n## Event Does Not Equal Explanation\n\nWe create stories all the time to explain or make sense of events - it is just in our nature. It isn't bad. But after we create those explanations, we forget that these are stories we created and view these explanations as the truth.\n\nThe event of failing a test is very different from the explanation or assessment being made of it of \"I am stupid\".\n\nThe question is not whether your story is right or wrong. Rather, is your story working for you given the results you say you want? If not, you can always learn to author more powerful stories that will serve you better in designing the life you want.\n","n":0.026}}},{"i":204,"$":{"0":{"v":"Assertions","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n# Assertions\n\nAn assertion is a speech act where the speaker establishes the facts of life - what is true or false for the speaker and listener.

The main focus in FPC 2 is how to intervene at the system level, which requires understanding the unit of a system: the individual.\n\nWhile the literature on intrapersonal models are in agreement, Systems work is still an active area of research, so this might change.\n\n1.

However, they don't see it as resignation, it shows up as grounded realism.\n\nIn resignation, there is a tention between an assessment of facticity (we would like things to be different) and an assessment of possibility (things will not change regardless of what we do). This shows up as accepting that theoretically, something could be different but not knowing how to make the change ourselves. Since we don't know what to do, we do nothing.\n\n## Moving Out Of Resignation\n\nTo move from resignation to [[humans.emotions.ambition]]:\n\n* Reexamine the grounding of those assessments behind the resignation. Often, we don't do something because we assume someone will decline a request before we ask.\n* Resignation can happen because we just don't see what actions to take. Reexamining the grounding of the assessments won't help here. Instead, we can engage in conversations about possible actions to produce change. When we don't know what to do next, we can take reflective action - the action that could take us to the actions that will take us where we want to go. This is action on our actions.\n\n    We can learn to expand our capacity for action when we don't know what to do next.

Resentment shows up indirectly when something is holding someone back from full commitment to their behaviour or if something is interfering with their ability to work with others.\n- There's usually a story about why the conversation can't be public. E.g, other people won't understand, or it'll be even worse if I complain publicly.\n- Anger can turn into resentment because of being in a weaker power position. E.g, resenting someone who humuliated you by abusing their power and to complain would invite retribution. Uneven distribution of power happens everywhere in society.\n- Resentment corrodes everyone involved.\n    \n    -Those in resentment pay by being in constant suffering - there is no joy or happiness in resentment. Resentment also reduces possibilities for action, as it diverts us to an obsessive conversation about what was lost in the past and who should be blamed. Conversations about the future are also contaminated by that assessment since we live in the assessment of being treated unfairly from now on. Possibilities for the future become new ways for expanding the resentment.\n    - Those being resented are surrounded by hidden currents even if they're not aware of it. They are disrupted whenever they try to coordinate action and someday, they will pay for what they were silently accused of.\n- Resentment can be reconstructed by the underlying story - we're the victims here and we had the moral right to have something and we deserve better. Therefore, something is to blame for the situation. The linguistic reconstruction for resentment is:\n\n    - I assert that X has happened\n    - I assess that X did damage me and restricted my current possibilities\n    - I assess that this is not fair\n    - I declare \"A\" responsible for this ( A\" being a person, a group of persons, an institution, etc.)\n    - I assess there is nothing I can do now to get \"A\" to repair the damage inflicted on me\n    - I declare this is not right (it should not be or it should be different)\n    - I declare that sometime, somewhere, somehow \"A\" will pay for this.\n- From this reconstruction, we can see that resentment involves a tention between an assessment of facticity (\"things should be different\") and a simultaneous assessment of possibility (\"there is nothing I can do now\")\n\n## Moving Out Of Resentment\n\nTo move from resentment to [[humans.emotions.acceptance]]:\n\n* Reexamine the grounding of the accusation of the resentment. We may find the person being blamed is not responsible for the situation, or that there is no one to blame or that we have our fair share of responsibility.\n* If the accusation is well-grounded, explore the possibility of coming to terms with the past and closing the private conversations of resentment.\n    * Reexamine the assessment that keeping the accusation silent and not speaking up is grounded. There may be room for making a complaint or requesting for a promise for the other person to not act in the same way again. We can also ask for compensation for what has happened. Resentment often happens when we don't even consider the possibility of making a complaint and requesting a change in behavior.\n    * Declare [[humans.language.declarations.forgiveness]]\n    * Sometimes, the wrong being done is so unacceptable that it doesn't make sense to keep the relationship with the other person. The way to end the resentment could be to end all relations with the other person.\n    * Even the option of severing all ties may be impossible usually due to a dependence on the other person.\n\n## Anticipating Resentment\n\nWhen designing systems, it is possible to anticipate the possibility of resentment occuring (e.g, in organizations) and the following things can be done to avoid it:\n\n* *Making clear promises*: when people assess that promises made to them were not fulfilled, this creates resentment. This usually happens when the promises both parties heard were different. This occurs with promises that have unclear conditions of satisfaction or different standards between both parties to assess the commitment by. Hence, it is important to make [[clear promises|humans.language.requests-and-offers#elements-of-an-effective-request--offer]] and check how the promises were listened. However, there is always ambiguity in communication, this is a facticity of human communication.\n* *Making mutual commitments to share some private conversations*: to deal with resentment before it can grow, we can mutually agree to share private conversations we have with one another if we assess that it interferes with coordinating action together. This allows identify resentment at its source and dealing with it as soon as it appears. There must be enough safety for everyone involved so that people believe they will not be negatively affected by sharing those conversations.\n    \n    This does not mean making public all private conversatiaons, we have a right to privacy. The conversations that we commit to share are the ones we think can interfere with our ability to coordinate action.","n":0.035}}},{"i":210,"$":{"0":{"v":"Emotions and Moods","n":0.577},"1":{"v":"\n# Emotions And Moods\n\nWe cannot make good decisions without emotions, for emotions are the precursor to action.

It is unlikely that someone is not feeling anything, they are more likely hurt and choose to shut down to protect themselves.\n- _Indifference_: selectively turning off emotions for particular things. This allows focus on things that matter, but be careful of it becoming a mood.\n- _Cynicism_: cynics are first idealists. they are eventually disappointed and they stay resigned. cynics tend to make other people feel resigned as well so that they themselves do not have to try again.\n    The skeptic is  earnestly trying to grow but is just being cautious.

This person will not be convinced when receiving advice contrary to what they already decided and will keep going around asking for advice until they receive advice that aligns with what they want to do in the first place.\n3. Therefore, the responsibility of that decision is no longer theirs and is instead pushed to the person which provided that advice.\n\nIn other words, confusion happens when someone is not ready to step into an identity.\n\n---\n\nThanks Wynn for this summary.\n","n":0.056}}},{"i":212,"$":{"0":{"v":"Basic Moods of Life","n":0.5},"1":{"v":"\n# Basic Moods Of Life\n\nThis is a reconstruction about 4 basic conversations about what is possible, which generates 4 different moods about life itself.\n\n## Assessments Of Facticity vs Possibility\n\nIn life, we make the distinction between:\n\n- _Facticity_: the facts of life, what is, what cannot be changed no matter what we do.\n\n  1. _Ontological facticity_: ontological meaning it is part of the nature of human existence and cannot be changed:\n\n     - Biological: we can only do what our biology allows us to do. We age, have a finite lifespan and will eventually die.\n     - The past cannot be changed. We can still reinterpret the past, but the fact of events having taken place which influences the present cannot be changed.\n\n  2. _Historical facticity_: things that cannot be changed because of the historical circumstances surrounding them, not due to limits of the human condition. These are things that could not be done today, but could be possible in the future. For example, communicating with someone across the world would not be possible in the previous century - it would have been considered an ontological facticity but is now a historical facticity.\n\n     Historical facticity is not a matter of fact, it is an assessment. Something normally considered a historical facticity may be seen as possible as a leader, which is what makes them leaders. This is subject to our ability to innovate and make grounded assessments.\n\n- _Possibility_: things that we assess we can change and hence, offers possibility for action.\n\nAssessments of historical facticity or possibility are themselves historical. It depends on the [[humans.language.declarations]] made and actions that follow. What might be impossible could now be possible because someone said it was so and acted to create that possibility. For example, the space program resulted in man stepping on the moon.\n\n## Accepting Or Opposing Facticity And Possibility\n\nSince the distinction of what is facticity and what is possibility is an assessment, someone might see something as a fact of life while someone else sees the same thing as being possible to change. These different views create different observers of what is possible in life. Since different assessments about the same thing are possible, someone can accept or oppose the way someone else makes those assessments of facticity or possibility.\n\nOne way of assessing someone's compitency in making the distinction between facticity and possibility is the grounding provided for those assessments. Much suffering is caused by incompetence when grounding assessments about what is or is not possible - for example, this causes someone to change what others groundedly assess as unchangeable, or declaring unchangeable what others consider possible to modify.\n\nWe can have grounded assessments about what is fact vs possibility. But we may oppose these assessments and not come to terms with them, which can generate 4 different moods about life.\n\n## The Basic Moods Of Life\n\n|           | Facticity (what we cannot change) | Possibility (what we can change) |\n| :-------: | :-------------------------------: | :------------------------------: |\n| We oppose |  [[humans.emotions.resentment]]   | [[humans.emotions.resignation]]  |\n| We accept |  [[humans.emotions.acceptance]]   |   [[humans.emotions.ambition]]   |\n","n":0.045}}},{"i":213,"$":{"0":{"v":"Ambition","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n# Ambition\n\nAmbition is the opposite of [[humans.emotions.resignation]].\n\nAmbition is our ability to recognize possibilities that can change the way things are now.

When there is an incomplete unit of work, there is resistance somewhere along this cycle of experience that prevents the work from completing. Energy is released and available for other units of work only when the cycle of experience is complete.\n\nThis appears to be related to the needs satisfaction cycle, but it uses slightly different terminology.\n\n![The Cycle of Experience described below](../assets/images/cycle-of-experience-9f655f1f-3b85-4866-ac2c-5e7ae024e519.jpg)\n\nWe have many needs and cycles of experience going at once, and we can interrupt this cycle, preventing that need from being met. The indented items are resistances happening between each stage of the cycle of experience that prevent us from proceeding further along the cycle.\n\n1. _Sensation_: something figural happens that disturbs the individual from the steady state. E.g, feeling that my throat is dry.\n   - _Desensitization_: this happens before reaching awareness. The person who is desensitizing does not even become aware of the need. Often occurs as a result of abuse. E.g, feeling nothing when someone shouts at you.\n2. _Awareness_: awareness of sensation causes the need to do something e.g I need a drink of water\n   - _Deflection_: excuses that you use to deflect the need, e.g changing topics in a conversation or making a joke\n3. _Mobilization of Energy_: committing to satisfying that need and getting ready to take action\n   - _Introjection_: all the should nots, excuses and justifications that we use to avoid taking action\n4. _Action_: taking an action to satisfy that need\n   - _Projection_: this happens before reaching contact. Projecting your thoughts onto other people, guessing how they think or feel.\n       This is also where you try to rescue others by getting them to engage in units of work that you yourself have not completed. For example, the regret from not expressing your feelings for a loved one who passed away causes you to nag others to do so for their own loved ones. The desire to rescue others can be prevented by doing your own self-work to establish healthy boundaries so you know what units of work is yours, and which can only be done by others.\n   - _Retroflection_: working against our need and redirecting the contact to ourselves instead. E.g, using porn\n5. _Contact_: when the need is met\n   - _Egotism_: refusing to be satisfied by making it about yourself. e.g i was praised but i resisted the satisfaction by saying they don't really know what kind of person i am\n6. _Satisfaction_: satisfaction that the need is met\n   - _Confluence_: your work is done, but because of others, you can't leave. e.g i'm no longer depressed but my best friend is, i cant say i am not because it will be leaving him\n7. _Withdrawal_: letting go for a new sensation to arise\n\n## Resistances Are Not Always Negative\n\nResistances can also be a form of intervention. To end sexual harassment, the would-be perpetrator should use introjection to curb the impulse. To improve mental health, use desensitization and ignore the news.\n\nSome amount of resistances is also normal and healthy. We would be overwhelmed without resistances which prevents us from being able to process too many units of work simultaneously. It is also a critical mechanism for survival and well-being.\n\n* * *\n\nThanks Wynn for this summary.\n\n## References\n\n- [Gestalt Cycle of Experience](http://www.clevelandconsultinggroup.com/articles/gestalt-cycle-of-experience.php)\n- See this [video on the cycle of experience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZyF0JsyreM).

Therefore, content reveals context. If I see orchids (content), I'm not in a desert (context). Conversely, if I'm in a desert, I will not see orchids.\n\n## Context\n\nContext is a Latin word: con = together, text = weave. I.e, context means to weave together.\n\nContext is often invisible and in the background, which gives it its power.\n\nContext and content in separation is difficult to interpret. Context gives meaning to content. We make lots of [[humans.language.assessments]] to make meaning.\n\nThe prevailing context can assimulate other contexts into it. E.g, this happens with prevalent moods in companies. \n\nThis seems obvious once pointed out, but we can fall into operating from a particular context habitually in everyday life without being consciously aware of it.\n\nExamples of context:\n\n* OAR and BEL are examples of contexts. This context will determine the content (results) that you generate.\n* Who said something, the time and place where something took place.\n* Countries have context. The same person could drive differently - obeying the speed limits etc in one country while disregarding them in another.\n* Companies have context. If you're in a company for a long time, it is a context that you can fit into.\n* In coaching, disliking someone is a context. The key is to be aware of it and not allowing that to affect what you're doing.\n* In coaching, the content (what the coachee says) reveals context. If the issue of not enough time always comes up in coaching, a typical solution is time management skills. In ontological coaching, the coach listens for the context of \"there is not enough time / money / ...\" - which becomes a very different conversation vs one about time management.\n* Wanting to be right is normal, but this is a context. Because of wanting to be right, there is less openness to any new information that would make us wrong. E.g, no one wakes up and wants to be wrong.\n* Likewise with the tendency to look for answers. Once answers are obtained, exploration tends to stop.\n\n### Example\n\nI did this exercise in a teleclass from Newfield.\n\nTry to interpret this statement in isolation:\n\n> I think that there’s a lot of people more concerned about being precisely, factually, and semantically correct than about being morally right.\n\nSome possible interpretations:\n\n* This statement is qualitative / vague\n* The statement is correct\n* Statement is judgmental\n* What does morality mean?\n\nGiven some additional information, interpret the following:\n\n> Interviewer:\n> One of the criticisms of you is that your math is fuzzy.
