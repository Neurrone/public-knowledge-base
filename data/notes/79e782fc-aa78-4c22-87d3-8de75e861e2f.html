<p>These notes are from the Psychological Safety workshop (now <a href="https://thethoughtcollective.arlo.co/w/courses/14-power-dynamics-and-psychological-safety">Power Dynamics and Psychological Safety</a>) by The Thought Collective taken on 12 Nov 2020.</p>
<p>Unlike <a href="/notes/1c4be4f8-5e9e-45b5-bd86-f39a185a69a4">Fpc2</a>, this is only a 1 day workshop which assumes no familiarity with FPC material.</p>
<p>Because psychological safety is related to system work, most of the content introduced overlapped with FPC 2. I found that being familiar with this material from FPC 2 improved my learning a lot, as I could spend my attention on understanding how the pieces fit together.</p>
<p>Since time was limited, we learned about how to spot lack of safety. Intervention strategies to create safety will hopefully be covered in another day.</p>

<li><a href="/notes/47d08eb0-ff77-46c5-b54c-f26fc7b76406">Marshaks Table</a>: psychological safety is needed for things that are under the table and are not discussed to come onto the table.</li>
<li><a href="/notes/4818624c-d589-4139-95cd-162b764d4fb2">Trust</a>: how trust is built. Trust is related to but is not the same as psychological safety.</li>
<li><a href="/notes/9a569d67-01fd-4c15-93b0-108a15a78369">Organism and Environment</a>: we instinctively feel safer the more we know about our environment. What we see also influences how safe we feel.</li>

<li><a href="/notes/032b0892-e70c-4007-b228-de252a722b39">Psychological Safety</a>: what is psychological safety? Safety is also only useful to reveal sufferring and for diagnostic work, not intervention.</li>
<li><a href="/notes/e6f17cdb-97ea-4d5b-b63f-5d1d076a1966">5 Conversations for Human Work</a>: when there is no safety in the wider system, create safety by setting up <a href="/notes/788b6732-fc11-4cbe-8998-b43bef4c9912">Containers In Systems</a> for these conversations to take place.</li>
<li>intervention work: FPC 2 stuff - power, resistance, culture, container building etc</li>
