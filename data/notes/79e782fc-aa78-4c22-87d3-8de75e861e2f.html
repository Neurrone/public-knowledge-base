<p>These notes are from the Psychological Safety workshop (now <a href="https://thethoughtcollective.arlo.co/w/courses/14-power-dynamics-and-psychological-safety">Power Dynamics and Psychological Safety</a>) by The Thought Collective taken on 12 Nov 2020.</p>
<p>Unlike <a title="Private" href="https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/hfyvYGJZQiUwQaaxQO27q.html" target="_blank" class="private">humans.fpc2 (Private)</a>, this is only a 1 day workshop which assumes no familiarity with FPC material.</p>
<p>Because psychological safety is related to system work, most of the content introduced overlapped with FPC 2. I found that being familiar with this material from FPC 2 improved my learning a lot, as I could spend my attention on understanding how the pieces fit together.</p>
<p>Since time was limited, we learned about how to spot lack of safety. Intervention strategies to create safety will hopefully be covered in another day.</p>
