1. Positive emotions (this is more than happiness)
2. Engaged in a flow state: complete absorption in an activity, complete focus on the task at hand
3. Relationships: positive relationships, feeling support and love from others
4. Meaning: purpose in life,belonging to or serving something greater than yourself
5. Accomplishment / achievements: Accomplishment includes the concepts of perseverance and having a passion to attain goals. But flourishing and wellbeing come when accomplishment is tied to striving toward things with an internal motivation or working toward something just for the sake of the pursuit and improvement.
