# Systems And Gestalt Theory

## Systems Theory

- This is a very analytical approach
- Focuses on patterns, cause/effect, finding out _what is missing_
- Historical analysis
- Looks at what is scarce
- This is diagnostic work

## Gestalt Theory

Takes an opposite approach to system theory in many ways.

- Focuses on completion, wholism, positives
- Focuses on the hear and now (the past will take care of itself when you're healthy)
- Abundance-based approach

> We are not agents of change: we are agents of awareness

Gestalt practitioners believe that [[change should come from the individual|humans.paradoxical-theory-of-change]], and that their role is to provide awareness.
