Wireguard looks like a great VPN solution, but seems quite hard to configure. The documentation is also not that beginner-friendly.

- [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) aims to be much easier to use than Wireguard, and supports Windows and iOS too. I've also heard good things about it from existing users.
  - [headscale](https://github.com/juanfont/headscale) is an open-source implementation of the Tailscale control server
- [Innernet](https://blog.tonari.no/introducing-innernet) aims to be an alternative to Tailscale where you can run the key distribution server yourself. Currently no support for Windows or iOS yet though, but something to keep an eye on.
