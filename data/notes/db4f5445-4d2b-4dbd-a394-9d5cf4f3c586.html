<blockquote>
<p>Don't rock the boat</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Each member of a group mistakenly believes their needs are counter to the group.</li>
<li>Therefore, no objections are raised.</li>
<li>The group decides on an action that does not fulfill the needs of many or all individuals in the group.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is different from groupthink. In groupthink, individuals are generally acting with accordance to what they want and feel good about group decisions.</p>
