# Abilene's Paradox

> Don't rock the boat

1. Each member of a group mistakenly believes their needs are counter to the group.
2. Therefore, no objections are raised.
3. The group decides on an action that does not fulfill the needs of many or all individuals in the group.

This is different from groupthink. In groupthink, individuals are generally acting with accordance to what they want and feel good about group decisions.
