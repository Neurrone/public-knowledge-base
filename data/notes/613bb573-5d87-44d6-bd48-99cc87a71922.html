<h3 id="level"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading" href="#level"><svg aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a>Level</h3>
<p>The biggest lever that controls compensation is level. Each level has a salary range and they overlap: if level 4 is $125k-$155k, level 5 might be $145k-$160k. There are seperate bands for base and equity.</p>
<p>However, a higher level isn't just a free higher salary: it comes with higher job expectations. It’s better to be on the high end of lower level band. You should target a level you’re confident you can be promoted within 1 year and target the higher end of the band.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&#x26;v=hU6BVxtGd5g">Tell the right story to avoid being downlevelled</a>. But don't try to be moved to a level where you are not capable of performing at, as that is bad for everyone involved.</p>
<p>When getting an offer, ask the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>What level is the job offer? What are the requirements for this level vs. the level above it?</li>
<li>What is the salary band for this level? This is 100% completely reasonable thing to ask.</li>
<li>How much is the equity worth currently? You can also ask: what percentage of the company does the equity represent? What is the valuation of the company?</li>
<li>What is the vesting schedule? Is there a 1 year cliff? Are there quarterly vesting deadlines I should know about? Confirm whether the equity was quoted to you on a yearly basis or over 4 years.</li>
</ul>
<p>Start negotiating once you're convinced the level is right. Target a total compensation number that’s in the upper half of the band for your level.</p>
<p>The most reliable way to get more money is through competing offers. Consider interviewing with your 2nd or 3rd tier choices or getting a counter-offer from your current employer.</p>
<p>If you can’t get what you want, offer to shift between compensation components but don’t back down on total compensation. In order of difficulty: base salary, equity, signing bonus. Offer to shift some base to equity first and as a last measure, ask for a larger signing bonus.</p>
