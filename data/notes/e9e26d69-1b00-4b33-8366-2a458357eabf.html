<p><a href="http://www.stefankiss.sk/modules.php?name=Content&#x26;pa=showpage&#x26;pid=30">Silenzio</a> is a free program which prevents audio devices from going to sleep a few seconds after no audio has been played.</p>
<p>This ordinarily does not cause a problem except that when audio plays after the sound device goes to sleep, there is noticeable latency of up to a second between the sound playing and when the device turn back on. This is unacceptable if you're using a screen reader or doing any sort of professional audio work.</p>
<p>At time of writing, the latest version is 2.1. The web page is not in English so this is the <a href="http://www.stefankiss.sk/programy/silenzio/Silenzio_2.1_setup.exe">direct link for the installer</a>.</p>
