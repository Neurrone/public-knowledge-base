## Higher Elevation Beans Are Better

Coffee grown at higher elevations produce harder and denser beans. These beans are higher quality as they contain more sugars which produces better flavours.

Harsh growing conditions slow the maturation process so that there is more time for complex sugars to develop, producing better flavours. Fewer plants survive, reducing the chance of disease.

4000 feett (1200 m) and above is considered high.

Coffee grown at different elevations are associated with different flavours.

* below 2,500 feet (762 m): soft, mild, simple, bland
* around 3,000 feet (914 m): sweet and smooth
* around 4,000 feet (~1,200 m): citrus, vanilla, chocolate, or nutty notes
* above 5,000 feet (~1,500 m) might be spicy, floral, or fruity

## Exceptions At Lower Elevations

Coffee grown at lower elevations can still develop slowly if subject to harsh conditions.

* Hawaiian Kona coffee: Hawaii is so far north of the equator that its coffee is still excellent
* shade-grown coffee: blocks the sun so coffee grows more slowly
