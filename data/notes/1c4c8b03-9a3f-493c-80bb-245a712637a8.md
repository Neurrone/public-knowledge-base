[^1]: one way of getting attention before trust is built with the system is to use the [Perceived Weirdness Index](http://www.ideasunlimited.com/blog-leadership-development/perceived-weirdness-index/). Doing something "weird" enough to draw attention, not too much though which provokes rejection. E.g, standing in front barefooted.
