<blockquote>
<p>People change when they give up trying or struggling to be what they would like to become; when they allow themselves to be currently what they are now at this moment in time; and when they become fully aware of who or what that is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The paradoxical theory of change says that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Change occurs when one becomes what he is, not when he tries to become what he is not.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Gestalt theory, the practitioner believes that they are agents of awareness, not change.</p>

<p>I've always thought of change in the past as changing myself to be a certain way due to some perceived flaw. This involves changes in an aspect of personality or behaviour. E.g, being better with people, being able to present or facilitate conversations better.</p>
<p>Sometimes I succeed, but more often than not I didn't. This was like trying to change into someone that I was not.</p>
<p>After I stopped trying so hard to change and as I've done more self-work, I've found it easier to move from the fitting in to the belonging end of the spectrum. That self-work has revealed some answers about who I already am. Doing things consistent with that is much easier, effortless even as I learn to act from congruence.</p>
<p>In that process of letting go and discovering what I already am, I have found that I have changed a lot - paradoxically, this only happened when I became who I already am.</p>
