# Backup For Docker Containers

tags: [[#todo|tags.todo]]

There's a tool called [docker-backup](https://github.com/muesli/docker-backup) that does this but I've not tried it.

In theory this is generally straightforward: back up volumes and bind mounts which the containers use.

## Databases

Doing a naive backup by copying the files for a database while its running could cause files to be inconsistent, so you should use the database's dump tool instead to get a consistent copy (e.g, [[Mysqldump|tools.mysql.mysqldump]]).

Its safe to do a copy while the database is not running.

There are also some tools to automate the process of doing regular database dumps:

### MySQL

- [mysql-backup](https://github.com/databacker/mysql-backup), [mysql-backup on dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/databack/mysql-backup)
  y\* [docker-mysql-cron-backup](https://github.com/fradelg/docker-mysql-cron-backup)
