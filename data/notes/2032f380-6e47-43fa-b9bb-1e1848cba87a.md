## Dynamic Git Identities

If you have work-related stuff in a specific folder, use this snipet in .gitconfig to change to using a work-related email:

```
[user]
  name = Dickson Tan
  email = personal@example.com

[includeIf "gitdir/i:**/workcompany/**"]
  email = work@workcompany.com
```

## Sort Git Branches By Recency

`git branch` shows branches alphabetically. To sort by recency instead, add this to .gitconfig:

```
[branch]
  sort = -committerdate
```
