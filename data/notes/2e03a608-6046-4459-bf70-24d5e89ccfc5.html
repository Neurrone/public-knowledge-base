<p>Coffees are graded by size because larger bean sizes usually produce better coffee.</p>
<p>In the grading process, coffee beans are sifted through screens, with each screen having specifically sized holes in them.</p>
<p>Screens are numbered 8 - 20, and the number is how many 64ths of an inch wide they are. E.g, a size 8 screen is 8/64 inches wide. The coffee's size is the smallest hole that it passes through, e.g a size 18 if it passes through a size 18 screen but not a size 16.</p>
<ul>
<li>20/64: very large. Unfortunately they are fragile and are an exception to the bigger is better rule</li>
<li>18 / 64: grade AA, also called large, superior or supremo depending on region</li>
<li>16/64: grade AB, also called large, Segundas or Excelso depending on region</li>
</ul>
<p>Coffees smaller than size 16 would be used in cheap coffees.</p>
