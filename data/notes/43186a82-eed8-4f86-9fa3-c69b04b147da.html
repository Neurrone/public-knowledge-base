<p>An assertion is a speech act where the speaker establishes the facts of life - what is true or false for the speaker and listener. For example, I am 6 feet tall, it is 32 degrees outside.</p>
<ul>
<li>Assertions are where language is the most descriptive and least generative.</li>
<li>Assertions are either true or false and can be verified by an objective third party with <em>the requisite distinctions</em>. E.g, the distinction of feet to verify if a room is 60 by 30.</li>
<li>Assertions belong to the thing being observed. The room is 30 by 20 is a property that belongs to the room.</li>
<li>Assertions are descriptive and factual, and are about the past or present.</li>
<li>Assertions are not influenced by mood or emotions.</li>
<li>Socially, we are expected to only make true assertions and provide supporting evidence if asked.
Language generates and creates, not just describes. You'll be seen as "trustworthy" or "reliable" if you continue to make true assertions over time. If you fail to back up the assertions you make or make false assertions over time, you're seen as a "liar".</li>
</ul>
