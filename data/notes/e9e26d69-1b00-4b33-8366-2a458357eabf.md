# Silenzio

[Silenzio](http://www.stefankiss.sk/modules.php?name=Content&pa=showpage&pid=30) is a free program which prevents audio devices from going to sleep a few seconds after no audio has been played.

This ordinarily does not cause a problem except that when audio plays after the sound device goes to sleep, there is noticeable latency of up to a second between the sound playing and when the device turn back on. This is unacceptable if you're using a screen reader or doing any sort of professional audio work.

At time of writing, the latest version is 2.1. The web page is not in English so this is the [direct link for the installer](http://www.stefankiss.sk/programy/silenzio/Silenzio_2.1_setup.exe).
