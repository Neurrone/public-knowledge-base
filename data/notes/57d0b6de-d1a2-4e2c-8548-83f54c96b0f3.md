# Postgres

## Configuration

- [Postgresco.nf](https://postgresqlco.nf/) has recommendations for how to tune and configure various Postgres parameters, and documentation in a convenient readable format
- [PGTune](https://pgtune.leopard.in.ua/) generates configs for various scenarios that can be used as a starting point

## Connection Pooling

- [PgBouncer](https://www.pgbouncer.org/)
- [Pgpool](https://www.pgpool.net/mediawiki/index.php/Main_Page), apparently more versatile than PgBouncer

  > PostgreSQL currently lacks the ability to efficiently pull a list of unique values from an ordered index. Even when you have an index that matches the exact order and columns for these "last point" queries, PostgreSQL is still forced to scan the entire index to find all unique values. As a table grows (and they grow quickly with time-series data), this operation keeps getting slower.

## Text Vs Varchar

The `text` data type has no limits on string length and seems like an easy choice over using `varchar`, as there are no performance advantages to using `varchar` over `text`. However, using `varchar` can help [enforce constraints on reasonable text lengths](https://brandur.org/text) and prevents storage of too much data.
