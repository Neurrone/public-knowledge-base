<p>It is important to have contracting conversations to set the context of the coaching. This is also part of the ICF core competencies as well as the code of ethics.</p>

<p>This sets up the global and goal agreement. Things to cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>Coaching: what is coaching, differences between coaching and other support professions</li>
<li>Ethics: limits on confidentiality, right to quit for either party at any time, conflicts of interest</li>
<li>Logistics: when and how to meet, fees, cancellation policies</li>
<li>Ontological coaching: explain OAR in a way that is accessible for the client. "In what area of your life would you like to show up as a different observer?"</li>
<li>Goals:
<ul>
<li>On a scale of motivation, where are you now?</li>
<li>Why do you want to be coached? Why now?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
