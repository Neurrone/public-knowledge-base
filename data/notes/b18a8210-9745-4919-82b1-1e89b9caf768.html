<p>Most systems (political, economic etc) exist to manage scarcity. Organizations either create or manage the distribution of resources.</p>
<p>There are 2 types of resources:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Tangible resources</em>: what usually comes to mind - capital, money, infrastructure, natural resources</li>
<li><em>Intangible resources</em>: human dynamics. E.g, trust, power, relationships</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The allocation of tangible resources depends on the allocation of intangible resources</li>
<li>Interventions restore abundance to the system</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>Abundance was present first in the book of Genesis. The serpent introduced introduced the idea of there being fruit that isn't available (scarcity). This now introduces <em>choice which is powerful in abundance, but ugly in scarcity</em>.</li>
<li>The human body (TODO)</li>
