# Reflections From FPC2

Personal reflections and other misc odds and ends that don't fit anywhere else.

## Reflections

This is stuff I understand from seeing first-hand or takeaways from my own experiences. I can't put this into words, for now.

- Systems can be really powerful for healing.
- Systems can also be incredibly violent as well. It takes very little for things to explode.
- Self awareness is critical for separating out purely intrapersonal work from work that should be brought up to the system level.
- The system can be smart enough to have answers that you don't. Whether the system is agile and adaptive depends on whether the system knows.
- Learning to tap into intuition.
- I noticed an unspoken cultural norm that you must always have an answer. A valid response (assuming the prerequisite safety is present) is also "I don't know, but I'm willing to learn how".

## What Next?

I started to be preoccupied with the question about what next on the second last day of the course.

- If you're the only individual in a system you care about with this knowledge, how can this scale to be more sustainable?
- How can this be taught to others? A lot of what I learnt in FPC 2 was highly experiential. Should this experience be replicated or is there another way to teach this stuff?
- How can we tap on the wisdom of emotions to show up in the context of the workplace? Most offices reward operating purely from cognition, but that's only part of what makes us human.
