# Immune System

The immune system provides innate immunity and adaptive immunity.

* Innate immunity: nonspecific defence mechanisms. Keeps invaders out or neutralizes them shortly after they get into our bodies. It can distinguish between self (what is allowed) and non-self (what is not allowed inside the body). E.g, the physical barrier of the skin, hair in the nose etc.
* Adaptive immunity: neutralizes invaders when they get past inate immunity. Recognizes antigens  (unique proteins which help identify the type of  pathogen), like a signature. It reads these signatures and creates specialized white blood cells called lymphocytes when it sees pathogens to be destroyed.
    
    The immune system has memory and can remember a pathogen the next time it sees it to know how to respond.

The immune system has many different components, so the concept of boosting a specific part of it won't work. E.g, the body expels excess vitamins if you take too much.

The one thing that definitely works to boost the immune system is a vaccine. It contains a weakened form of the pathogen that has the antigen signature which triggers the adaptive response.
