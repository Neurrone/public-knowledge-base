<p>Two pointers is a problem solving technique where two pointers are moved to find the solution.</p>
<h2 id="preconditions"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#preconditions"></a>Preconditions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Finding two values that meet a certain criteria (e.g, two numbers that add to a given value, two points of an array)</li>
<li>Data is ordered in some way, or it is possible to move closer to a solution by moving one / both pointers</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="example-problems"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#example-problems"></a>Example problems</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/">3Sum</a>: sort the array. For each element, we want to find two other numbers so that the sum of all 3 add to zero. To find the two numbers, initialize two pointers at the start and end of the array, moving the left / right pointer depending on whether a smaller or larger sum is needed.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/">two sum problem</a> can also be solved with this approach, but in that case, using a hash table is an easier solution.</li>
