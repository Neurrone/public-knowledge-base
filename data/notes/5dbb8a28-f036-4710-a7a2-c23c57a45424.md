# Be-Do-Have Model

Here are 2 ways of seeing the world.

## Have-Do-Be

1. I have a degree from Harvard.
2. Therefore, I can do something that I could not have without this degree.
3. I am successful, because I have.

People who operate in this way tend to feel insecure about their identity. Asians tend to operate from have-do-be.

## Be-Do-Have

1. I am someone with honesty and integrity.
2. That's why I do what I do.
3. Because I do what I do, I have what I have.
4. Even if you take away what I have, I'm still a person of honesty and integrity.
