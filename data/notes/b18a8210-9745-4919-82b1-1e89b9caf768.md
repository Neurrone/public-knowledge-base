# Abundance and Scarcity

Most systems (political, economic etc) exist to manage scarcity. Organizations either create or manage the distribution of resources.

There are 2 types of resources:

1. _Tangible resources_: what usually comes to mind - capital, money, infrastructure, natural resources
2. _Intangible resources_: human dynamics. E.g, trust, power, relationships

- The allocation of tangible resources depends on the allocation of intangible resources
- Interventions restore abundance to the system

## Examples

1. Abundance was present first in the book of Genesis. The serpent introduced introduced the idea of there being fruit that isn't available (scarcity). This now introduces _choice which is powerful in abundance, but ugly in scarcity_.
2. The human body (TODO)
