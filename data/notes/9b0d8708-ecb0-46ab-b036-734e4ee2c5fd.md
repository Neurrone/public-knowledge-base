# VoiceOver On Mac

Compared to iOS, Apple is updating the Voiceover screen reader on the Mac far less often, which makes me weary of using one. Basic features such as indentation reporting aren't present, which makes programming difficult.

* Someone created a [thread on AppleVis claiming comparable efficiency with screen readers on Windows](https://www.applevis.com/forum/macos-mac-apps/tips-power-usersanyone-does-more-read-emailslight-web-browsing-be-more). This is something I'll investigate when I get the time and opportunity to use a Mac.
