## Syntax

```
chkdsk [options] c:
chkdsk /r /f c:
```

Options: 

* `/f` to force a lock on the drive and fix errors
* `/r` to attempt recovery of bad sectors (takes longer)
* `/perf` uses more system resources to complete faster (works only on NTFS drives), use this if not using the computer while its running


I have a reminder to run this every 2 months on my internal drives and any external hard drives and SSDs as a form of preventative maintenance / early warning for impending drive failures.
