<p>Context generates content. Therefore, content reveals context. If I see orchids (content), I'm not in a desert (context). Conversely, if I'm in a desert, I will not see orchids.</p>
<h2 id="context"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading" href="#context"><svg aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a>Context</h2>
<p>Context is a Latin word: con = together, text = weave. I.e, context means to weave together.</p>
<p>Context is often invisible and in the background, which gives it its power.</p>
<p>Context and content in separation is difficult to interpret. Context gives meaning to content. We make lots of <a href="/notes/86c2c093-d948-4a9b-844a-0900d2816b39">Assessments</a> to make meaning.</p>
<p>The prevailing context can assimulate other contexts into it. E.g, this happens with prevalent moods in companies. </p>
<p>This seems obvious once pointed out, but we can fall into operating from a particular context habitually in everyday life without being consciously aware of it.</p>
<p>Examples of context:</p>
<ul>
<li>OAR and BEL are examples of contexts. This context will determine the content (results) that you generate.</li>
<li>Who said something, the time and place where something took place.</li>
<li>Countries have context. The same person could drive differently - obeying the speed limits etc in one country while disregarding them in another.</li>
<li>Companies have context. If you're in a company for a long time, it is a context that you can fit into.</li>
<li>In coaching, disliking someone is a context. The key is to be aware of it and not allowing that to affect what you're doing.</li>
<li>In coaching, the content (what the coachee says) reveals context. If the issue of not enough time always comes up in coaching, a typical solution is time management skills. In ontological coaching, the coach listens for the context of "there is not enough time / money / ..." - which becomes a very different conversation vs one about time management.</li>
<li>Wanting to be right is normal, but this is a context. Because of wanting to be right, there is less openness to any new information that would make us wrong. E.g, no one wakes up and wants to be wrong.</li>
<li>Likewise with the tendency to look for answers. Once answers are obtained, exploration tends to stop.</li>

<p>I did this exercise in a teleclass from Newfield.</p>
<p>Try to interpret this statement in isolation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think that there’s a lot of people more concerned about being precisely, factually, and semantically correct than about being morally right.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some possible interpretations:</p>
<ul>
<li>This statement is qualitative / vague</li>
<li>The statement is correct</li>
<li>Statement is judgmental</li>
<li>What does morality mean?</li>
</ul>
<p>Given some additional information, interpret the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Interviewer:
One of the criticisms of you is that your math is fuzzy. The Washington Post recently (2018) awarded you four Pinocchios</p>
<p>Interviewee:
I think that there’s a lot of people more concerned about being precisely, factually, and semantically correct than about being morally right.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some possible responses:</p>
<ul>
<li>What's the connection to morality?</li>
<li>Is the interviewee a right-wing politician in the US?</li>
</ul>
<p>Given even more information, interpret the statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The interviewee is Donald Trump</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some possible interpretations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Given my assessment of Donald trump, I'll write whatever he said off completely. This dismissiveness could also show up elsewhere.</li>
<li>This sounds like something Trump might say</li>
</ul>
<p>Given one more piece of information: the interviewee is actually Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s, and this is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/01/07/alexandria-ocasio-cortezs-very-bad-defense-her-falsehoods/">the article her quote was from</a>.</p>
<p>Possible interpretations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Feeling betrayed</li>
<li>Surprise that this was from a democrat instead of a republican</li>
<li>Finally have the answer (and therefore, this predisposes you to being less open to more information or being curious)</li>
<li>Attempting to force this new information to fit into your original assessments</li>
</ul>
