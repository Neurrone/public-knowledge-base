# Facilitating Powerful Conversations Level 2

> The natural state of systems is decay.

These notes are from the course [Facilitating Powerful Conversations (FPC) Level 2 by The Thought Collective](https://thethoughtcollective.arlo.co/w/courses/3-facilitating-powerful-conversations-level-2) taken on 5 - 9 Oct 2020.

FPC 2 is a highly experiential course which distills the learning from the [iGOLD program](https://www.gestaltod.org/programs/igold-program/about-the-igold-program/). It builds up from FPC level 1 which focuses on self awareness and discovery. A system is a group of individuals that come together for a common purpose. The main focus in FPC 2 is how to intervene at the system level, which requires understanding the unit of a system: the individual.

While the literature on intrapersonal models are in agreement, Systems work is still an active area of research, so this might change.

1. [[humans.systems.why-things-are]]: why are things the way they are, and what causes scarcity?
2. [[What to intervene on|humans.systems.patterns]]: patterns useful for diagnosis
3. [[Where to intervene: containers|humans.systems.containers]]
4. [[How to intervene|humans.systems.intervention]]
5. Who intervenes: [[humans.use-of-self]] / self-work. The use of self is the foundation on which everything else above stands.

Misc notes that don't fit in anywhere else:

- Shadow systems are non-legitimate systems set up to gain power. E.g The Gatekeepers, the Pyramid Club. Whether they are good or bad is down to intention
- [[humans.fpc2.reflections]]
