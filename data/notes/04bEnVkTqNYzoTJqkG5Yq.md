# Ambition

Ambition is the opposite of [[humans.emotions.resignation]].

Ambition is our ability to recognize possibilities that can change the way things are now. Ambition is related to someone's disposition towards the future.

When reconstructed linguistically, it is an assessment of the future as an open space of possibilities. Ambitious people commit to getting the most from future possibilities and this corresponds with the motivation to overcome and go beyond the present. This enables them to generate new realities which do not exist today. Simply put, an ambitious person sees possibilities for action where others don't.
