# API Clients

Alternatives to Postman.

## Standalone Clients

- [HTTPie](https://httpie.io/docs): call APIs from the command line, much more user-friendly than Curl. Gui wrappers are available.
  - [xh](https://github.com/ducaale/xh) uses HTTPie's design and syntax but in Rust for better performance
- [Curlie](https://github.com/rs/curlie): a frontend to curl that adds the ease of use of httpie, without compromising on features and performance.
- [Hurl](https://hurl.dev/) is a command line tool that also looks promising.

## Curl Converter

[Curl Converter](https://curlconverter.com/) converts curl commands into code in several languages.

## Vs Code Extensions
