# API Clients

Alternatives to Postman.

## Standalone Clients

- [HTTPie](https://httpie.io/docs): call APIs from the command line, much more user-friendly than Curl. Gui wrappers are available.
  - [xh](https://github.com/ducaale/xh) uses HTTPie's design and syntax but in Rust for better performance
- [Hurl](https://hurl.dev/) is a command line tool that also looks promising.

## Vs Code Extensions

- [Restclient](https://github.com/Huachao/vscode-restclient)
- [thunder-client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rangav.vscode-thunder-client) - note that this is not open source
