# API Clients

Alternatives to Postman.

## Standalone Clients

* [HTTPie](https://httpie.io/docs): call APIs from the command line, much more user-friendly than Curl. Gui wrappers are available.

## Vs Code Extensions

* [Restclient](https://github.com/Huachao/vscode-restclient)
* [thunder-client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rangav.vscode-thunder-client) - note that this is not open source
