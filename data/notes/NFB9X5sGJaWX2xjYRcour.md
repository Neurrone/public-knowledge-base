# DRM Removal

DRM is evil and restricts what you can do with legitimately baught content.

## Ebooks

Use the [DeDrm_tools](https://github.com/apprenticeharper/DeDRM_tools/wiki/Exactly-how-to-remove-DRM) Calibre plugin. It supports removing DRM from purchased Kindle content but [requires use of an older Kindle version](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=283371).

When decrypting print-replica Kindle ebooks, use [KindleUnpack](https://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/KindleUnpack) (also available as a Calibre plugin) to extract the pdf. Print replica ebooks are just a PDF with some Amazon-specific wrapper.
