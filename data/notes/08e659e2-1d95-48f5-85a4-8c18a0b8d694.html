<p>These behaviours manifest when people feel unsafe. When someone observes these behaviours, it causes the observer to also feel that same unsafety.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Don't critique</em>: in the long run, doing this causes you to feel that things are boring / stagnant and that the system is not moving. When avoiding critique, the feeling that nothing moves (which comes from you intrapersonally) gets projected onto the system.</p>
<p>This comes from the mental script when in survival of not wanting to appear negative and a fear that others think you act with ill intent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Don't show weakness</em>: causes you to feel misunderstood in the long run. If there is pain that is not known to the system, this is a natural outcome.</p>
<p>This comes from the mental script of not wanting to show weakness to be seen as contributing. "Since everyone else also experiences pain, suck it up".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Don't offer ideas</em>: causes you to feel insignificant in the long run. Every idea that comes in can be disruptive and break the status quo.</p>
<p>This is based on the fear of disrupting the system, "don't want to be the one that shakes things up" and appear disruptive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don't ask questions: causes feelings of helplessness / being unable to affect change in the long run. Knowledge is the beginning of power. Without knowledge, you cannot affect change.</p>
<p>This comes from the mental script of "Other people think I should have known. Asking questions means I haven't been paying enough attention and therefore, I appear ignorant or uncaring". E.g, hearing that someone had a Miscarriage but not wanting to ask about how that person is.</p>
<p>Not asking questions here is different from not wanting to show weakness (that I did not know).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="preserving-trust"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#preserving-trust"></a>Preserving Trust</h2>
<p>Humans have a primal fear of not being trusted.</p>
<p>Each of these behaviours is an attempt at wanting to stay in <a href="/notes/4818624c-d589-4139-95cd-162b764d4fb2">Trust</a> with others.</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Don't criticize</em>: an attempt to maintain trust by sincerity.</li>
<li><em>Don't show weakness</em>: an attempt at preserving trust by competence.</li>
<li><em>Don't offer ideas</em>: an attempt to preserve trust by staying reliable.</li>
<li><em>Don't ask questions</em>: an attempt to preserve care.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>I personally don't quite understand the last point about preserving care as well as the others.</p>
