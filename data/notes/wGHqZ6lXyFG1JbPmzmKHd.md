# Water For Coffee

Water plays a big part in coffee, since most of coffee is actually water.

Having too much minerals in water could cause buildup of scale over time, which can damage espresso machines. However, distilled water won't taste good when used in coffee because it is the minerals in the water that help extract the coffee.

## Specialty Coffee Association Recommendations

The Target is the most desirable point in the Acceptable Range, although falling within the range is considered meeting the standard.
