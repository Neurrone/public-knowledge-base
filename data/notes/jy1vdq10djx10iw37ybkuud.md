# Sorting

Sorting is a useful technique for solving algorithm problems. The sorted data allows things like e.g, O(log n) searches.

## Example Problems

- [Detecting duplicates](https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/)
- [Detecting anagrams](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/): two strings are anagrams if sorting them produces the same result
- [Merging intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/)
- [Non-overlapping intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/non-overlapping-intervals/)
