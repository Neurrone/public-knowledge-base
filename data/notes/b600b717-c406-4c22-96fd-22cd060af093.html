<p>We cannot make good decisions without emotions, for emotions are the precursor to action. Even when we say that we should step back from our emotions and try to stay calm and rational, this means staying in a mood of calm.</p>
<h2 id="emotions"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading" href="#emotions"><svg aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a>Emotions</h2>
<p>Emotions are a predisposition to action in response to an external event. They typically last anywhere from seconds to days. Emotions tend to be much more visible to ourselves and others around us.</p>
<p>The 4 basic emotions are:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Anger</em></li>
<li><em>Fear</em></li>
<li><em>Sadness</em></li>
<li><em>Tenderness</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Unlike emotions, moods are predispositions to actions which do not come from an outside stimulus, but already exist within us. These moods then influence how we interpret future events. Moods are long-term, lasting anywhere from months to lifetimes. Moods are also much more difficult for us to see and are also usually not obvious to others.</p>
