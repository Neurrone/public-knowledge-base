# Sliding Window

## Prerequisites

- Solution involves contiguous parts of a Array or string
- It is possible to reuse previous computations when growing or shrinking the window

## Output

A contiguous part of the array / string as the solution

## Problems

- [Maximum Average Subarray I](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-average-subarray-i/): when sliding the window forward, the sum of the previous elements in the window can be reused.
- [Longest Repeating Character Replacement](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-repeating-character-replacement/): update a sliding window to find the required substring
- [Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/)
- [Minimum Window Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/)
