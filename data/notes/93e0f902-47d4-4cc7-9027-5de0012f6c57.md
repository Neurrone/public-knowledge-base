## Memory Leak in Serverless-Offline since 6.8.0

There is a [memory leak](https://github.com/dherault/serverless-offline/issues/1119#issuecomment-876463656) in Serverless-offline which leaks memory after an endpoint is invoked. Fortunately, there is a simple workaround for this, per the linked comment.

Add the `--allow-cache` option if running from CLI or edit serverless config to add `allowCache: true` to Serverless-offline options.

## V2 Uses Locally Installed Package Over Global Package

This caught us unaware. CI pipeline does `npm -i g serverless` to install v2.x but package.json specified an older v1.x version.

I couldn't figure out why it was using an older version until coming across the [v2 blog post describing this breaking change](https://www.serverless.com/blog/serverless-framework-v2) - if both a global and local install is available, the local one will be used.
