* [Rufus](https://github.com/pbatard/rufus) has been around for a long time and is popular. 
    * [HN discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27071982)
* [Ventoy](https://www.ventoy.net/en/index.html) is much newer. Its main claim to fame is letting you put multiple ISOs on the drive, and being able to choose which one to boot from without reformatting the entire drive when wanting to boot something new each time.
