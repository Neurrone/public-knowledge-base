# Coffee Grinder Burrs

Burrs in grinders for coffee come in 2 types: conical and flat.

## Conical Burrs

* Doesn't require as much energy to work, so are used in both manual and electric grinders
* Produce a bimodal distribution of grounds (grinds at the selected size as well as a bunch of fines or very small grounds)
* Adds more body for espresso. Smaller conical burrs also work for filter coffee, but larger burrs (e.g, 83 mm) produce less clear filters
* More suitable for use in medium to dark roasted espresso

## Flat Burrs

* Requires more energy to operate, only found in electric grinders
* Most people prefer flat burrs, more commonly found than conical burr sets in titan level grinders
* Produces a more unimodal distribution of grounds, easier to align than conical burrs as they only need to be parallel
* Produces espresso with less texture but more clarity for fruit notes in light roasts, can pull high extraction yield shots
* More clarity in filter coffee, better than conical for filter due to generating less fines

### Differences Between 98MM Flat SSP Burrs

This is what SSP says about the 98MM burrs they have available:

* 98MM high uniformity (HU): Single Dosing espresso, Clean cup, intensity, has a similar taste profile to the 64 MM unimodal multipurpose burrs
* 98MM low uniformity (LU): Espresso, brewing, bulk grinding, more complexity, Lower grinding temperature, used to be the default burr set in monolith flat max until the switch to Shuriken burrs.
* 98MM ultra-low fines: only suitable for brews (although I've heard some people having success with espresso but I'd imagine it'll be harder to pull shots)
* 98MM brew burrs: these are very new, there's a [thread on the HB forums discussing these new brew burrs](https://www.home-barista.com/brewing/ssp-98mm-brewing-burrs-t74971.html#p812987)

While deciding on which burr set to get for the [Lagom P100](https://www.option-o.com/shop/lagom-p100), this is the response I got from someone on the [Espresso Aficionados](https://espressoaf.com/) Discord:

> I think the question of "what burrs should I get?" is essentially unanswerable. 
>
> The question really comes down to a small portion related to the types of beans you like to work with and a larger part of the type of shots you want to pull. 
>
> Many folks prefer pulling faster 1:3 shots on 98mm HU, but I like HU for light roasted espresso pulled tight at 1:1.5 or less. 
>
> I prefer thick and juicy fruit bomb shots and for me, HU extracts enough of lighter roasts early in the pull to get me a high TDS and flavors that I prefer over longer shots that will be lower strength, but higher overall extraction. 
>
> I choose to balance extraction with brew temperature, rather than yield. If a shot is sour, I will pull it hotter, not longer. I only go longer when the tastes turn bad at hotter temps and it is clear that I need more yield to hit the sweet spot. But again, this is all meaningless unless you've sat down and had espresso with me and tasted what I make and said "yeah, I like that" or "nope, I want something different in the cup". Since I make espresso tailored to my tastes, my preferences are rather a moot point to everyone else...
>
> LU is great, but for me, I like the punchy character that I get with HU more than the softer flavors I tend to get with LU. Both will dial in just fine and make very similar beverages, but HU will have a higher TDS at a given ratio and thus mouthfeel and -to a lesser extent- body are increased.
>
> LU shots need to be shorter to match the mouthfeel of HU and since they are less aggressive on extraction, they require a slightly higher ratio to balance out the highs and the lows, which reduces strength and is just less appealing to my palate.
>
> Others will have different preferences, but we are splitting hairs here. Really fine hairs.
>
> For milk drinks, in not sure it much matters...
>
> Think about it this way:
>
> I pull short shots because I like the sensation of drinking them and the flavors pop. 
>
> In milk, if you extract more and have a less punchy shot as the base, you make up for that by adding less milk if the final beverage size stays the same. 
>
> So your option is less coffee and more milk with the tight shot or more coffee and less milk with the longer shot. 
>
> Seems to me the longer shot will cut through milk more than the short shot because it is equivalent to a larger dose of coffee in a fixed volume shot. I mean if you leave the basic recipe alone and just increase the yield, you are adding solids to a fixed-size final beverage.

And here's another thread on comparative differences between the burrs:

> Based on second-hand experience and looking at the geometries and reading SSP's descriptions  this is my best guess:
>
> - ULF is the one that gives you a semi-traditional espresso shot. Low outfall = more fines. But at brew range, it delivers the most clarity and the less fines. Will excel at 1:2.2.
> - HU has the most fines at spro range, it will extract fast and short. Good if you want high ey at 1:2.2.
> - LU is the one that has the less fines at espresso range due to the high outfall. It will extract slower and need a slightly higher ratio to reach balance. Good if you want high ey at 1:3 and mid ey at 1.2.2.
> - 98 Brew is like LU but on steroids, higher outfall, even less fines.

> LU is generally seen as better for brew than HU and more forgiving of coffee flaws but more demanding on puck prep.
>
> HU is the ultimate in clarity and has more fines so less demanding on puck prep.
>
> Then there is the new SSP Brew which like the name suggests really is for brew not espresso

Based on this, I decided on the LU burrs.
