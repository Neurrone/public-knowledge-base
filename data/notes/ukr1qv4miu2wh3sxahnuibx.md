# Fast-slow Pointers (Floydâ€™s Cycle Detection Algorithm)

This technique maintains two pointers that traverse a data structure at different speeds, hence why it is also known as the tortoise and hare algorithm.

## Prerequisites

- A data structure like an array, directed graph (often used in linked lists)

## Output

- Traits about the data structure depending on usage. Often used for cycle detection in O(1) space

## Problems

- [Linked list cycle](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/)]
- [Happy number](https://leetcode.com/problems/happy-number/)
- [Remove Nth Node From End of List](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/)
