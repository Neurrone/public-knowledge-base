<p>Coffee grown at higher elevations produce harder and denser beans. These beans are higher quality as they contain more sugars which produces better flavours.</p>
<p>Harsh growing conditions slow the maturation process so that there is more time for complex sugars to develop, producing better flavours. Fewer plants survive, reducing the chance of disease.</p>
<p>4000 feett (1200 m) and above is considered high.</p>
<p>Coffee grown at different elevations are associated with different flavours.</p>
<ul>
<li>below 2,500 feet (762 m): soft, mild, simple, bland</li>
<li>around 3,000 feet (914 m): sweet and smooth</li>
<li>around 4,000 feet (~1,200 m): citrus, vanilla, chocolate, or nutty notes</li>
<li>above 5,000 feet (~1,500 m) might be spicy, floral, or fruity</li>
</ul>

<p>Coffee grown at lower elevations can still develop slowly if subject to harsh conditions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hawaiian Kona coffee: Hawaii is so far north of the equator that its coffee is still excellent</li>
<li>shade-grown coffee: blocks the sun so coffee grows more slowly</li>
</ul>
