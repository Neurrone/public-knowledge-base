<p>The natural state of systems is decay.</p>

<p>These notes are from the course <a href="https://thethoughtcollective.arlo.co/w/courses/3-facilitating-powerful-conversations-level-2">Facilitating Powerful Conversations (FPC) Level 2 by The Thought Collective</a> taken on 5 - 9 Oct 2020.</p>
<p>FPC 2 is a highly experiential course which distills the learning from the <a href="https://www.gestaltod.org/programs/igold-program/about-the-igold-program/">iGOLD program</a>. It builds up from FPC level 1 which focuses on self awareness and discovery. A system is a group of individuals that come together for a common purpose. The main focus in FPC 2 is how to intervene at the system level, which requires understanding the unit of a system: the individual.</p>
<p>While the literature on intrapersonal models are in agreement, Systems work is still an active area of research, so this might change.</p>

<li>Shadow systems are non-legitimate systems set up to gain power. E.g The Gatekeepers, the Pyramid Club. Whether they are good or bad is down to intention</li>
