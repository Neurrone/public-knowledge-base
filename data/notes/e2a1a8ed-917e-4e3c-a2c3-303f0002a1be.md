# Types of Containers In Human Systems

Containers are set up by:

1. _Infrastructure_: how groups are formed (linguistically), where groups meet, seating, etc
2. _Knowledge_: what knowledge does the group have? Does everyone in the group have the same knowledge?
3. _Identity and boundaries_: how you present yourself also forms a boundary.
4. _Relationships_: what are the existing relationships in the system?
5. _Language and Emergent Language_: linguistic clarity / construction, emergent language (my FPC2 cohort adopted the term "pop corn" participation)
