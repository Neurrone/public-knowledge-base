<p>The CPF is a compulsory savings scheme for Singapore residents and permanent residents.</p>
<p>Employees earning > $500 / month working in Singapore must contribute a portion of their salary to their CPF account. Employers must also make a separate contribution to the employee's CPF account. CPF contributions only apply up to a monthly gross wage of $6000.</p>
<p>Payments such as bonuses or commissions also attract CPF contributions as well.</p>
<p>There are 4 sub-accounts under the CPF:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ordinary Account (OA): used for education, housing, insurance, investment. Interest rates are 3.5% per annum for the first $20,000, and 2.5% otherwise.</li>
<li>Special Account (SA): investment in retirement-related financial products</li>
<li>Medisave Account (MA): approved health insurance and hospitalization</li>
<li>Retirement Account (RA): for retirement, automatically created upon turning 55 by merging OA + SA</li>
</ul>
<p>MA and SA accounts have an interest rate of up to 6% for combined balances up to $60,000. Balances above this have an interest of 4%.</p>
