## Remapping Letter Of Mapped Network Drive

I saw this in [this forum post](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-networking/changing-drive-letter-of-a-mapped-network-drive/89d53c88-3b3a-4b4b-9508-6e7799258f4a)

1. Launch regedit.exe.
2. Go to `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Network\`
3. The children of this key are the drive letters being used for network drives. Right-click and rename the key.
4. Restart the machine for the changes to take effect.
