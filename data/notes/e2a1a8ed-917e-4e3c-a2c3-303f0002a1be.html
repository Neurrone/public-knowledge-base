<p>Containers are set up by:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Infrastructure</em>: how groups are formed (linguistically), where groups meet, seating, etc</li>
<li><em>Knowledge</em>: what knowledge does the group have? Does everyone in the group have the same knowledge?</li>
<li><em>Identity and boundaries</em>: how you present yourself also forms a boundary.</li>
<li><em>Relationships</em>: what are the existing relationships in the system?</li>
<li><em>Language and Emergent Language</em>: linguistic clarity / construction, emergent language (my FPC2 cohort adopted the term "pop corn" participation)</li>
</ol>
