## Reading Books / Papers

- [InftyReader](http://www.inftyreader.org/?p=29) converts PDFs with math into text with math in TeX
- [arXiv archive](https://arxiv.org/): has LaTeX source of many papers
- [ar5iv](https://ar5iv.org/) renders papers on arXiv in html using the LaTeX source. Math is rendered via MathML. Replace the x with 5 in arXiv urls to get a HTML version
- [arXiv Vanity](https://www.arxiv-vanity.com/) renders papers on arXiv in html using the LaTeX source. Math has LaTeX alt text
- [I-Stem](https://portal.istemai.com/register): converts inaccessible PDFs containing math to HTML
- [SciA11y](https://scia11y.org/): a prototype that provides access to 1.5m scientific documents published before Apr 2020
- [Paper to HTML Converter ](https://papertohtml.org/) is an experimental project that converts pdf to html via machine learning models
- [LaTeX Access](https://sourceforge.net/projects/latex-access/): scripts for more easily reading LaTeX source. E.g, `\frac{x}{2}` gets read as `x over 2`
