# Contracting Conversations

It is important to have contracting conversations to set the context of the coaching. This is also part of the ICF core competencies as well as the code of ethics.

## First Conversations

This sets up the global and goal agreement. Things to cover:

* Coaching: what is coaching, differences between coaching and other support professions
* Ethics: limits on confidentiality, right to quit for either party at any time, conflicts of interest
* Logistics: when and how to meet, fees, cancellation policies
* Ontological coaching: explain OAR in a way that is accessible for the client. "In what area of your life would you like to show up as a different observer?"
* Goals:
    * On a scale of motivation, where are you now?
    * Why do you want to be coached? Why now?
