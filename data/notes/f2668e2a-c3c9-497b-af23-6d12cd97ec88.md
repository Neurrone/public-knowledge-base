# Rust GUIs On Windows

Also see [are we gui yet?](https://www.areweguiyet.com/)

There are many projects in this space, but most of them don't support accessibility technologies, all the ones listed here should.

## Native Windows Bindings

- [Winsafe](https://crates.io/crates/winsafe)
- [native-windows-gui](https://github.com/gabdube/native-windows-gui)

## Cross-platform

- [Iced](https://github.com/hecrj/iced) looks promising, support for accessibility is still under development though
- Using JavaScript for the frontend and leaving the backend to Rust seems much saner than dealing with lifetimes
  - [alcro](https://github.com/Srinivasa314/alcro) requires an existing installation of a chromium browser, e.g microsoft chromium-based Edge
  - [Tauri](https://tauri.studio/en/) makes use of the native browser (IE or Edge) for rendering. This feels like a framework though, and I'm not sure if I'd need the extra stuff
  - [Crux: Cross-platform app development in Rust](https://redbadger.github.io/crux/)
  - [Webview bindings](https://github.com/Boscop/web-view)
- [accesskit](https://github.com/AccessKit/accesskit) should hopefully solve this problem properly in the long-term by making it easier to implement native accessibility APIs
- Bevy-egui has early support for emiting events which can be hooked to simulate a screen reader. See https://github.com/ndarilek/bevy_egui_a11y/tree/main/src for a very early prototype
- [Dioxus](https://dioxuslabs.com/guide/)
