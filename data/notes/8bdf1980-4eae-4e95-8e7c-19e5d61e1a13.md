## Usage

```sh
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C 'some comment' -f outfile -N ''
```

* `-t`: specify the type of key to generate. `ed25519` is recommended as it is more secure and is shorter than RSA keys
* `-C`: a comment for the key
* `-f`: the output file to write the keypair to
* `-N`: the password used to protect the private key
