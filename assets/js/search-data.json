Fortunately, it is possible to move VMs to another location.\n\nAs of Apr 2021, there isn't a builtin command that does this easily, so it needs to be done by exporting and reimporting the VM, specifying a new location to store it during the import process.\n\n```sh\n# if Docker is running, shut it down first\nwsl --shutdown\nwsl -l -v # check that all VMs are stopped\n\n# export the VM into a tar file\nwsl --export ubuntu-20.04 \"D:\\wsl-backups\\ubuntu-20.04.tar\"\n\n# unregisters (deletes) the VM, make sure you have backed it up first\nwsl --unregister ubuntu-20.04\n\n# import from the tar file created earlier\n# in this example, the VMs are stored in D:\\documents\\wsl2-vms\n# in windows explorer, ensure that the folder does not have NTFS compression enabled (hyper-v machines cant start if stored in an NTFS compressed folder)\nwsl --import ubuntu-20.024 \"D:\\documents\\wsl2-vms\\ubuntu-20.04\" \"D:\\wsl-backups\\ubuntu-20.04.tar\" --version 2\n```\n\nOnce the VM is recreated, the default username that WSL uses to log into it needs to be configured again, otherwise it'll be defaulting to root:\n\n```sh\nubuntu2004 config --default-user <some-user>\n```\n\nInstructions from [this issue on Github](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/WSL/issues/412#issuecomment-629387956).\n\n### Moving Docker VMs\n\nThe process for moving the location of VMs used by the WSL2 backend is identical:\n\n```sh\n# shut down docker first\n# there are 2 VMs to move\n\nwsl --export docker-desktop \"D:\\wsl-backups\\docker-desktop.tar\"\nwsl --export docker-desktop-data \"D:\\wsl-backups\\docker-desktop-data.tar\"\n\nwsl --unregister docker-desktop\nwsl --unregister docker-desktop-data\n\nwsl --import docker-desktop \"D:\\documents\\wsl2-vms\\docker-desktop\" \"D:\\wsl-backups\\docker-desktop.tar\" --version 2\nwsl --import docker-desktop-data \"D:\\documents\\wsl2-vms\\docker-desktop-data\" \"D:\\wsl-backups\\docker-desktop-data.tar\" --version 2\n```\n\n## Compacting WSL2 VMs\n\nTechnically this procedure is going to work for any hyper-v VM (.vmdx); it boils down to using diskpart to compact the VM:\n\n```sh\ndiskpart\n# in the diskpart prompt\nselect vdisk file=\"D:\\documents\\wsl2-vms\\ubuntu\\ext4.vhdx\"\ncompact vdisk\n```\n\nReference: [How to Shrink a WSL2 Virtual Disk](https://stephenreescarter.net/how-to-shrink-a-wsl2-virtual-disk/)","url":"https://kb.neurrone.com/notes/c580cd60-ccde-4c24-b6af-e87c19c2b2a3.html","relUrl":"notes/c580cd60-ccde-4c24-b6af-e87c19c2b2a3.html"},{"doc":"Vpn","title":"Vpn","hpath":"tools.vpn","content":"\n","url":"https://kb.neurrone.com/notes/863ef124-d377-4a99-87c6-b59d0a406ea1.html","relUrl":"notes/863ef124-d377-4a99-87c6-b59d0a406ea1.html"},{"doc":"Wireguard-based VPNsaws","title":"Wireguard-based VPNsaws","hpath":"tools.vpn.wireguard","content":"\nWireguard looks like a great VPN solution, but seems quite hard to configure.

Try these instead.\n\n* Tell me about a time a team member changed your mind? This lets you know if the leader feels they are the only one who has the answers or if they are open to different opinions. You are going to learn how they prefer to receive information and what they value. \n* Tell me about someone you are proud of. This is going to let you know which behaviors and skills they value. You can also learn their attitude towards developing people and celebrating success along the way. \n* Do you fully disconnect during holidays and vacations? Does this leader believes in boundaries and having time off and space that is protected? Or is this someone that will be calling you on your holiday—and will that work for you?\n* Describe a recent success or win. They should be able to come up with something pretty quickly. If they can’t, that might indicate that they aren’t great about celebrating progress or recognizing people along the way to milestones. They don’t have to describe a huge win. However, they should be able to think of a recent event that demonstrates progress.\n* Tell me about a disagreement or conflict on the team.  Every team is going to have conflict. It is a great way to generate ideas and different thinking when the team has the right tools to navigate constructive conflict. You want to see is if the leader says: “We don’t have conflict.” This could mean that different opinions aren’t welcome, and the team sits in silence. Or the leader is trying to avoid the hard conversations that yield better results. The leader should be able to talk about people having different opinions they had to work through.\n* How did you start your last team meeting? Did they jump right into the agenda?  Did they have an activity or conversation to learn more about each other? You can learn a lot about interactions by how they begin meetings and conversations.\n* What is your ideal person for this role?  This is a great way to understand what the leader values and the knowledge, skills, and behaviors they view as making their work easier. They will probably describe the person’s organization, communications, skill set, or certain outcomes achieved. This response helps you get an idea if you fit with the leader’s ideal candidate.\n* Who have you promoted and why? If the leader has never promoted anyone, probe further to understand what is done to develop people. If they are a newer manager and haven’t had the opportunity, ask what they are doing to help grow and develop their team. It is ok if the leader hasn’t promoted anyone. What you want to hear is the thought around it and how they view their role in developing people on the team.\n* Tell me about the last person you recognized. Recognition can be a thoughtful conversation, an email, an award, or even a mention in an all-hands meeting. You want to see if the leader struggles to come up with an example or easily mentions individual and team recognition. Does the leader have the mindset that development includes helping people see the contributions they are making?\n* How do you focus on your own growth and development? Does the leader mention reading articles, listening to podcasts, reading books, having a mentor, taking courses, or having a coach? Are they actively trying to develop themselves? If they are developing themselves, they are more likely to develop their team. If they aren’t, you want to understand why. If they blame their schedule or struggle to find an answer, then odds are good your opportunity for development will be pushed aside. \n\nReference: [10 questions to ask in a job interview that will really expose a company’s culture](https://www.fastcompany.com/90622890/10-questions-to-ask-in-a-job-interview-that-will-really-expose-a-companys-culture)\n","url":"https://kb.neurrone.com/notes/c7b287fe-14f3-4dea-9c45-b6c46ad8d8c2.html","relUrl":"notes/c7b287fe-14f3-4dea-9c45-b6c46ad8d8c2.html"},{"doc":"Hiring","title":"Hiring","hpath":"tech-interview.hiring","content":"\n# Hiring\n\n## Interview Questions\n\nQuestions off the beaten path\n\n* Walk Me Through Your Development Environment And Tools You Use\n* What Do You Do For Fun?\n* How Do You Learn New Technology?\n\n---\n\nReferences:\n\n* [The Responses I Got From a Software Developer Candidate That Made Me Hire Him](https://medium.com/illumination/the-responses-i-got-from-a-software-developer-candidate-that-made-me-hire-him-98ff8bf01298)\n","url":"https://kb.neurrone.com/notes/2d98a342-a309-4132-a96d-11c201a2a37c.html","relUrl":"notes/2d98a342-a309-4132-a96d-11c201a2a37c.html"},{"doc":"Tags","title":"Tags","hpath":"tags","content":"\n","url":"https://kb.neurrone.com/notes/091b67bf-8bfa-454c-bbd3-7d84d8216229.html","relUrl":"notes/091b67bf-8bfa-454c-bbd3-7d84d8216229.html"},{"doc":"Todo","title":"Todo","hpath":"tags.todo","content":"\n# Notes Tagged Todo\n","url":"https://kb.neurrone.com/notes/44fa9314-0fb7-4ef2-bbb7-bf30fd5b5560.html","relUrl":"notes/44fa9314-0fb7-4ef2-bbb7-bf30fd5b5560.html"},{"doc":"Sfx","title":"Sfx","hpath":"sfx","content":"\n# Sound Effects And Music\n\n* [list of places to find sounds and music](https://forum.audiogames.net/topic/28122/list-of-places-to-find-sounds-and-music/)\n* [Free voiceover generator](https://www.voicebooking.com/en/free-voice-over-generator): account creation is free and gives you more features\n","url":"https://kb.neurrone.com/notes/b4fc6d48-17ae-4764-acdb-ec0f52707860.html","relUrl":"notes/b4fc6d48-17ae-4764-acdb-ec0f52707860.html"},{"doc":"Dev","title":"Dev","hpath":"dev","content":"\n# Development\n\nNotes on programming languages, databases, best practices etc\n\n","url":"https://kb.neurrone.com/notes/8ec37b11-59ad-4ea8-82d9-3186e7e0cd29.html","relUrl":"notes/8ec37b11-59ad-4ea8-82d9-3186e7e0cd29.html"},{"doc":"Web","title":"Web","hpath":"dev.web","content":"\n","url":"https://kb.neurrone.com/notes/3d77adfc-5373-4700-a129-e297ad6521b5.html","relUrl":"notes/3d77adfc-5373-4700-a129-e297ad6521b5.html"},{"doc":"Security","title":"Security","hpath":"dev.web.security","content":"\n","url":"https://kb.neurrone.com/notes/1f14eba7-ff8d-4ee4-a64b-5f2f7e02b4f6.html","relUrl":"notes/1f14eba7-ff8d-4ee4-a64b-5f2f7e02b4f6.html"},{"doc":"Cors","title":"Cors","hpath":"dev.web.security.cors","content":"\n## Origin\n\nThis is a combination of 3 things: scheme, fully qualified hostname and port.\n\nhttp://example.com and https://example.com are different origins due to the difference in schemes and ports.\n\n## Cross-origin Resource Requests\n\nThis means a resource on one making a request for something on another origin.

Instead, put the required amount of boiling water first into the brewer, then add the coffee. This makes the drawdown much faster, up to twice as fast as coffee first then water.\n5. Stir gently to ensure no dry pockets of coffee.\n6. Leave for 2 minutes to steep.\n7. Break the crust of coffee that forms on the surface of the brew. There're 2 ways of doing this, either is fine:\n    * Use a spoon to stir gently.\n    * For smaller brews, shake the brewer to evenly mix the coffee and water.\n8. After 30 seconds, place the brewer onto the cup to start the drawdown phase.\n9. Wait for the drawdown to complete.
