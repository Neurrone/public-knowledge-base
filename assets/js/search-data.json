Fortunately, it is possible to move VMs to another location.\n\nAs of Apr 2021, there isn't a builtin command that does this easily, so it needs to be done by exporting and reimporting the VM, specifying a new location to store it during the import process.\n\n```sh\n# if Docker is running, shut it down first\nwsl --shutdown\nwsl -l -v # check that all VMs are stopped\n\n# export the VM into a tar file\nwsl --export ubuntu-20.04 \"D:\\wsl-backups\\ubuntu-20.04.tar\"\n\n# unregisters (deletes) the VM, make sure you have backed it up first\nwsl --unregister ubuntu-20.04\n\n# import from the tar file created earlier\n# in this example, the VMs are stored in D:\\documents\\wsl2-vms\n# in windows explorer, ensure that the folder does not have NTFS compression enabled (hyper-v machines cant start if stored in an NTFS compressed folder)\nwsl --import ubuntu-20.024 \"D:\\documents\\wsl2-vms\\ubuntu-20.04\" \"D:\\wsl-backups\\ubuntu-20.04.tar\" --version 2\n```\n\nOnce the VM is recreated, the default username that WSL uses to log into it needs to be configured again, otherwise it'll be defaulting to root:\n\n```sh\nubuntu2004 config --default-user <some-user>\n```\n\nInstructions from [this issue on Github](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/WSL/issues/412#issuecomment-629387956).\n\n### Moving Docker VMs\n\nThe process for moving the location of VMs used by the WSL2 backend is identical:\n\n```sh\n# shut down docker first\n# there are 2 VMs to move\n\nwsl --export docker-desktop \"D:\\wsl-backups\\docker-desktop.tar\"\nwsl --export docker-desktop-data \"D:\\wsl-backups\\docker-desktop-data.tar\"\n\nwsl --unregister docker-desktop\nwsl --unregister docker-desktop-data\n\nwsl --import docker-desktop \"D:\\documents\\wsl2-vms\\docker-desktop\" \"D:\\wsl-backups\\docker-desktop.tar\" --version 2\nwsl --import docker-desktop-data \"D:\\documents\\wsl2-vms\\docker-desktop-data\" \"D:\\wsl-backups\\docker-desktop-data.tar\" --version 2\n```\n\n## Compacting WSL2 VMs\n\nTechnically this procedure is going to work for any hyper-v VM (.vmdx); it boils down to using diskpart to compact the VM:\n\n```sh\ndiskpart\n# in the diskpart prompt\nselect vdisk file=\"D:\\documents\\wsl2-vms\\ubuntu\\ext4.vhdx\"\ncompact vdisk\n```\n\nReference: [How to Shrink a WSL2 Virtual Disk](https://stephenreescarter.net/how-to-shrink-a-wsl2-virtual-disk/)","url":"https://kb.neurrone.com/notes/c580cd60-ccde-4c24-b6af-e87c19c2b2a3.html","relUrl":"notes/c580cd60-ccde-4c24-b6af-e87c19c2b2a3.html"},{"doc":"Vpn","title":"Vpn","hpath":"tools.vpn","content":"\n","url":"https://kb.neurrone.com/notes/863ef124-d377-4a99-87c6-b59d0a406ea1.html","relUrl":"notes/863ef124-d377-4a99-87c6-b59d0a406ea1.html"},{"doc":"Wireguard-based VPNs","title":"Wireguard-based VPNs","hpath":"tools.vpn.wireguard","content":"\nWireguard looks like a great VPN solution, but seems quite hard to configure.

Try these instead.\n\n* Tell me about a time a team member changed your mind? This lets you know if the leader feels they are the only one who has the answers or if they are open to different opinions. You are going to learn how they prefer to receive information and what they value. \n* Tell me about someone you are proud of. This is going to let you know which behaviors and skills they value. You can also learn their attitude towards developing people and celebrating success along the way. \n* Do you fully disconnect during holidays and vacations? Does this leader believes in boundaries and having time off and space that is protected? Or is this someone that will be calling you on your holiday—and will that work for you?\n* Describe a recent success or win. They should be able to come up with something pretty quickly. If they can’t, that might indicate that they aren’t great about celebrating progress or recognizing people along the way to milestones. They don’t have to describe a huge win. However, they should be able to think of a recent event that demonstrates progress.\n* Tell me about a disagreement or conflict on the team.  Every team is going to have conflict. It is a great way to generate ideas and different thinking when the team has the right tools to navigate constructive conflict. You want to see is if the leader says: “We don’t have conflict.” This could mean that different opinions aren’t welcome, and the team sits in silence. Or the leader is trying to avoid the hard conversations that yield better results. The leader should be able to talk about people having different opinions they had to work through.\n* How did you start your last team meeting? Did they jump right into the agenda?  Did they have an activity or conversation to learn more about each other? You can learn a lot about interactions by how they begin meetings and conversations.\n* What is your ideal person for this role?  This is a great way to understand what the leader values and the knowledge, skills, and behaviors they view as making their work easier. They will probably describe the person’s organization, communications, skill set, or certain outcomes achieved. This response helps you get an idea if you fit with the leader’s ideal candidate.\n* Who have you promoted and why? If the leader has never promoted anyone, probe further to understand what is done to develop people. If they are a newer manager and haven’t had the opportunity, ask what they are doing to help grow and develop their team. It is ok if the leader hasn’t promoted anyone. What you want to hear is the thought around it and how they view their role in developing people on the team.\n* Tell me about the last person you recognized. Recognition can be a thoughtful conversation, an email, an award, or even a mention in an all-hands meeting. You want to see if the leader struggles to come up with an example or easily mentions individual and team recognition. Does the leader have the mindset that development includes helping people see the contributions they are making?\n* How do you focus on your own growth and development? Does the leader mention reading articles, listening to podcasts, reading books, having a mentor, taking courses, or having a coach? Are they actively trying to develop themselves? If they are developing themselves, they are more likely to develop their team. If they aren’t, you want to understand why. If they blame their schedule or struggle to find an answer, then odds are good your opportunity for development will be pushed aside. \n\nReference: [10 questions to ask in a job interview that will really expose a company’s culture](https://www.fastcompany.com/90622890/10-questions-to-ask-in-a-job-interview-that-will-really-expose-a-companys-culture)\n","url":"https://kb.neurrone.com/notes/c7b287fe-14f3-4dea-9c45-b6c46ad8d8c2.html","relUrl":"notes/c7b287fe-14f3-4dea-9c45-b6c46ad8d8c2.html"},{"doc":"Hiring","title":"Hiring","hpath":"tech-interview.hiring","content":"\n# Hiring\n\n## Interview Questions\n\nQuestions off the beaten path\n\n* Walk Me Through Your Development Environment And Tools You Use\n* What Do You Do For Fun?\n* How Do You Learn New Technology?\n\n---\n\nReferences:\n\n* [The Responses I Got From a Software Developer Candidate That Made Me Hire Him](https://medium.com/illumination/the-responses-i-got-from-a-software-developer-candidate-that-made-me-hire-him-98ff8bf01298)\n","url":"https://kb.neurrone.com/notes/2d98a342-a309-4132-a96d-11c201a2a37c.html","relUrl":"notes/2d98a342-a309-4132-a96d-11c201a2a37c.html"},{"doc":"Tags","title":"Tags","hpath":"tags","content":"\n","url":"https://kb.neurrone.com/notes/091b67bf-8bfa-454c-bbd3-7d84d8216229.html","relUrl":"notes/091b67bf-8bfa-454c-bbd3-7d84d8216229.html"},{"doc":"Todo","title":"Todo","hpath":"tags.todo","content":"\n# Notes Tagged Todo\n","url":"https://kb.neurrone.com/notes/44fa9314-0fb7-4ef2-bbb7-bf30fd5b5560.html","relUrl":"notes/44fa9314-0fb7-4ef2-bbb7-bf30fd5b5560.html"},{"doc":"Sfx","title":"Sfx","hpath":"sfx","content":"\n# Sound Effects And Music\n\n* [list of places to find sounds and music](https://forum.audiogames.net/topic/28122/list-of-places-to-find-sounds-and-music/)\n* [Free voiceover generator](https://www.voicebooking.com/en/free-voice-over-generator): account creation is free and gives you more features\n","url":"https://kb.neurrone.com/notes/b4fc6d48-17ae-4764-acdb-ec0f52707860.html","relUrl":"notes/b4fc6d48-17ae-4764-acdb-ec0f52707860.html"},{"doc":"Dev","title":"Dev","hpath":"dev","content":"\n# Development\n\nNotes on programming languages, databases, best practices etc\n\n","url":"https://kb.neurrone.com/notes/8ec37b11-59ad-4ea8-82d9-3186e7e0cd29.html","relUrl":"notes/8ec37b11-59ad-4ea8-82d9-3186e7e0cd29.html"},{"doc":"Web","title":"Web","hpath":"dev.web","content":"\n","url":"https://kb.neurrone.com/notes/3d77adfc-5373-4700-a129-e297ad6521b5.html","relUrl":"notes/3d77adfc-5373-4700-a129-e297ad6521b5.html"},{"doc":"Security","title":"Security","hpath":"dev.web.security","content":"\n","url":"https://kb.neurrone.com/notes/1f14eba7-ff8d-4ee4-a64b-5f2f7e02b4f6.html","relUrl":"notes/1f14eba7-ff8d-4ee4-a64b-5f2f7e02b4f6.html"},{"doc":"Cors","title":"Cors","hpath":"dev.web.security.cors","content":"\n## Origin\n\nThis is a combination of 3 things: scheme, fully qualified hostname and port.\n\nhttp://example.com and https://example.com are different origins due to the difference in schemes and ports.\n\n## Cross-origin Resource Requests\n\nThis means a resource on one making a request for something on another origin.

Instead, put the required amount of boiling water first into the brewer, then add the coffee. This makes the drawdown much faster, up to twice as fast as coffee first then water.\n5. Stir gently to ensure no dry pockets of coffee.\n6. Leave for 2 minutes to steep.\n7. Break the crust of coffee that forms on the surface of the brew. There're 2 ways of doing this, either is fine:\n    * Use a spoon to stir gently.\n    * For smaller brews, shake the brewer to evenly mix the coffee and water.\n8. After 30 seconds, place the brewer onto the cup to start the drawdown phase.\n9. Wait for the drawdown to complete.

And this I must say is surely an act of love; for after over 20 years of meeting the needs of people in all levels of systems, I can tell you that this is a courageous and selfless act that is rare, and made even more difficult when our systems do not reciprocate.\n\nInterventions should restore abundance to the system. This requires that the intervener is also in a state of abundance to be able to give, only possible by managing the following types of debt:\n\n- _Somatic debt_: sleep, exercise, diet, ritual.\n- _Emotional debt_: moods affect our adaptability when we know longer experience a wide range of [[humans.emotions]], but a predictable response to similar situations.\n    The easiest way of dealing with this is to adopt [[temporary coping mechanisms|humans.emotions.coping-and-deplay-emotions]]. Since they only stop emotional spending and don't restore reserves, they can bring barrenness to a system if they become permanent.\n  - Attend to past trauma, as it very likely affects how you see.\n  - Make it a habitual choice to [[forgive|humans.language.declarations.forgiveness]], [[humans.trust]] and accept which reduces strong moods of anger, fear and sadness respectively.\n- _Language_: pay attention to your [[linguistic experience|humans.language]] and how you describe and assess the world.

Language is unique to humans. Distinctions create tribes. Trust is the phenomenon that shows us we're part of the same tribe.\n\nThe 4 levels of trust are:\n\n1. _Sincerity_: the other person's internal and external conversations are not contradictory, the other person acts in according to what they say they believe and care about. Are their intentions clear?\n\n   This should not be confused for care, because sincerity is about intention. A graphic illustration of this is if someone tells their date that they just want to have sex. This demonstrates sincerity but not care.\n2. _Competence_: the other person is able to do what they propose by having the knowledge, skill and resources needed to accomplish the task.\n3. _Reliability_: the other person has kept their promises in the past, and will continue to do so in the future.\n4. _Care_: the other person has our best interests in mind and will act in ways that reflect concern for our well-being and what we consider important. Can you identify with them?\n\nEach of these aspects of trust is an assessment we make of the other person. If we don't trust someone, it is usually because one of these is missing. It is normal to have a bias towards focusing on one or a few of these aspects. When you decide to trust someone, this is a declaration.\n\nExamples:\n\n- The levels are sequential, which shows up naturally in the course of an interview. Starting off with sincerity, the other pillars of trust are established.\n  1. Sincerity: starting the interview with a question like \"Tell us about yourself and why you're here\".\n  2. Competence: \"You mentioned doing xyz in your resume. Could you tell us more about that?\"\n  3. Reliability: \"What are your plans for the next few years?\"\n  4. Care: further questions to see if you identify with the other person\n- Bad salespeople try to sell you something and might do so by disguising their intentions (lack of sincerity) or even when they are sincere, they focus on closing that sale (lack of care for what you need).\n- How Tong Yee builds the container at the start of each course / workshop - he is very intentional about addressing each of these 4 aspects of trust.\n\n---\n\nSome of this explanation comes from Language and the Pursuit of Leadership Excellence.\n","url":"https://kb.neurrone.com/notes/4818624c-d589-4139-95cd-162b764d4fb2.html","relUrl":"notes/4818624c-d589-4139-95cd-162b764d4fb2.html"},{"doc":"Human Systems","title":"Human Systems","hpath":"humans.systems","content":"\n# Human Systems\n\nHow systems work and break down, how people act and interact in systems.\n","url":"https://kb.neurrone.com/notes/b581d909-3f25-4508-a61d-ce64a04c9a3b.html","relUrl":"notes/b581d909-3f25-4508-a61d-ce64a04c9a3b.html"},{"doc":"Why Things Are","title":"Why Things Are","hpath":"humans.systems.why-things-are","content":"\n# Why Things Are In Human Systems\n\nThese concepts explain why things happen in systems.\n\n1.

We are agents of awareness so that there is always choice.\n\nThe 4 roles the gestalt practitioner can adopt to intervene in a way which preserves choice, in order of invasiveness:\n\n1. _\"I notice\"_: \"I notice only half of the people in the room have spoken\". Simply a presentation of the data from observing emerging patterns and themes, providing new sensations for people to complete their own [[humans.cycle-of-experience]]. Avoid mixing it with other interventions.\n2. _\"I feel\"_: this is your emotion, mobilizing in you, it is not anyone elses. This maps to mobilization in the cycle of experience.\n\n   Avoid naming the emotions of others. Since you own your emotions, no one else can challenge them, vs other people challenging your assessments of their emotions.\n\n   Requires use of self.\n3. _\"Could you\"_: making a request to move the individual to action and contact in the cycle of experience.\n\n   This is a request, so the individual still has choice. There is a thin line here so be careful.\n4. _Grand theorizing_: uses abstract theories, concepts, generalizations and metaphors to make meaning of what was observed. Can clarify when the system is in confusion. Maps to satisfaction and withdrawal. E.g, \"Some discomfort is needed for learning\", \"getting buy-in from everyone seems to be an impossible task\"\n\nEach intervention should take 5 - 10 s max. Be clear and Concise. Get in. Get out.\n\nDifferent people have different needs, e.g some people need grand theories. Pay attention to the complaints of the system to decide which to use.\n\n## References\n\n- [Four Roles of the Gestalt Intervener: Holistic Presence Using Experiential Learning Theory](https://maraineyassociates.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Holistic-Presence-Using-Experiential-Learning-Theory.pdf)\n","url":"https://kb.neurrone.com/notes/6c5bba33-35e1-4f74-a8b5-dfe9dbd29c0e.html","relUrl":"notes/6c5bba33-35e1-4f74-a8b5-dfe9dbd29c0e.html"},{"doc":"Psychological Safety","title":"Psychological Safety","hpath":"humans.systems.psychological-safety","content":"\n# Psychological Safety\n\nThis is closely related to [[humans.trust]].\n\nThe formal definition of psychological safety is the shared belief that the team is safe for interpersonal risk taking.\n\nHere's a comparison with vulnerability and another definition that might make more sense:\n\n- _Vulnerability_: \"I share, and give you the benefit of the doubt that you're trustworthy\"\n- _Psychological safety_: \"I share, and you give me the benefit of the doubt - by culture, you will not judge me\".\n\nTaking a risk by asking questions, showing weakness etc could cause someone to have less trust in me. Providing the benefit of the doubt here refers to continuing to trust.\n\nFor example, showing weakness and admitting a mistake could immediately cause someone to doubt my competence and therefore, put less trust in me. If there is a culture of psychological safety, this is treated as a learning experience and I would work to avoid repeating that mistake.\n\nHowever, there is a balance to keep when extending the grace of benefit of the doubt. If someone is truly not performing and needs to be let go in a high stakes role, you can part ways and do so without destroying the other person. \"I can treat you as a friend, but I no longer trust your competence which is a critical part of what we're doing...\".\n\n## Safety Reveals Suffering\n\nThere is suffering when things aren't the way they should be.\n\nSafety reveals suffering, but _safety cannot heal suffering_. Hence, psychological safety is a means to an end (and not an end in and of itself) - the system is more agile or the team performs better.\n\nThis is because safety helps with diagnosis but not with intervention. E.g for conversation between friends, lots of things are discussed because there is a lot of safety, but people don't know what to do.\n\n## Safety And Competence\n\n_Psychological Safety must be matched with skill_. Once something is in the system that the system does not know how to handle, that causes safety to plummet.\n\nWhen doing systems intervention, remember to also diagnose how much competence there is in the system. Without competence, safety is premature.\n\nThe more competence in the system, the more issues start showing up, which might overwhelm the system.\n\nThis is also increasingly complex because other systems like friendship systems, family systems etc fail to catch units like unresolved trauma, ambitions or dreams which then shows up onto the work system. It is worth seeing if a unit of work can be taken care of in these other systems first.\n\n* * *\n\nMisc notes:\n\n- The lack of psychological safety is often associated with underlings in an organization. But many leaders also do not feel safe in the very systems that they are supposed to lead.\n- A tool like the staff climate survey can only be used in a culture which supports it. Leaders brace themselves for the results of these surveys in many organizations.\n\n","url":"https://kb.neurrone.com/notes/032b0892-e70c-4007-b228-de252a722b39.html","relUrl":"notes/032b0892-e70c-4007-b228-de252a722b39.html"},{"doc":"Power","title":"Power","hpath":"humans.systems.power","content":"\n# Power\n\nWork begins when there is desire to bring change. Power, the access to trust and influence, is needed for change.\n\n[[humans.trust]] is the basis of how power is used. Without trust, all types of power can be abused.\n\n## Power Is Assigned\n\n> Power cannot be taken. It can only be assigned.\n\nFor individuals that are perceived to be power hungry and have ceased power, they have coerced others and through that coercion, were assigned power.\n\nExamples:\n\n- A kidnapper threatens to kill your child unless a ransom of $10,000 is paid. There is a choice to pay the ransom[^1] and in that choice, this assigns coercive power to the kidnapper.\n- When the Germans took everything away from the Jews, the jews had nothing left. The Germans lost their hold on the Jews, since they chose not to assign any more power to their captors.\n\n## 8 Types Of Power\n\nThese are the 8 reasons that people would assign power. This is evidence-based from observation of human behavior.\n\nNew power isn't better than old power - each has their place.\n\n### Old Power\n\nTill the 1990s, these were the types of recognized power:\n\n1. _Legitimate_: power assigned to members of an institution, exists only if the institution remains. E.g, the family unit, monarchies, governments. The prime minister would no longer have any legitimate power if there is no longer a government.\n2. _Expert_: power assigned to individuals when they have mastery of a specific skill set.\n3. _Coercive_: assigned when someone has something they do not want to lose. This is not necessarily bad, e.g in the case of fitness instructors.\n4. _Reward_: assigned to someone which has something you want.\n\nThese forms of power are needed for leading and managing systems and to build systems up.\n\n### New Power (after 1990s)\n\nNew forms of power arising after the 1990s. Old forms of power diminish when affluence and knowledge increase. E.g, how the internet diminishes the influence of expert power.\n\n1. _Referent_: whether I can relate to you. Vulnerability allows leaders to be more relatable. E.g, Me Too movement.\n\n   Can be polarizing or fragmentary because some people will not be able to relate. E.g, people who are alienated because they cannot relate to the Me Too movement.\n2. _Information_: expert power is tied to experience and knowledge. Information power is tied to information and understanding of context. People who are in the grape vine have information power.\n3. _Moral_: practicing what you preach, whether people do what they say. Doesn't refer to goodness or righteousness.\n4. _Charismatic_: this is not charisma, though charisma is part of it. Refers to wholeness and health. We all experience aspects of life where we feel broken. Some people have done the work to heal. They have a quiet charisma, being whole and comfortable in their skin.\n\nThese powers are needed for healing and balance in systems.\n\n## How Power Relates To Be-Do-Have\n\nWith the [[humans.be-do-have]], the 8 powers can be plotted on a venn diagram with 3 components: be, do and have.\n\n- Have: legitimate, information and expert power are what you own.\n- Be ∩ Do: practicing what you preach, moral power\n- Be ∩ Have: referent power\n- Do ∩ Have: reward power - I can only give because I own\n- Do: coercive\n- Be: charismatic\n\n## Personal Biases\n\nEach person is biased about which power they respond to. For instance, a new director joining with little experience in the industry vs an assistant manager that has 25 years in the industry. Who would you assign more power to?\n\nAsians are biased towards using old power, since that is what they are shown as children. Legitimate and coercive power are the most commonly used in Asian parenting.\n\nThe takeaway here is to develop new forms of power for ourselves.\n\n## Alternative Paths To Success\n\nIt is commonly believed that you cannot affect change without legitimacy. For instance, from legitimacy, you gain expert then information power.\n\nToday, it is also possible to work backward. For instance, with referent power, you get more information power because people relate to you, which leads to expertise and legitimacy.\n\n[^1]: Most people would make the choice to pay the ransom, but it is still technically a choice\n","url":"https://kb.neurrone.com/notes/cabd702b-7d0e-439d-a4d8-00e3f4f7088e.html","relUrl":"notes/cabd702b-7d0e-439d-a4d8-00e3f4f7088e.html"},{"doc":"Patterns in Systems","title":"Patterns in Systems","hpath":"humans.systems.patterns","content":"\n# Patterns For Diagnosing Human Systems\n\n> The system can only respond to what the system sees.

Otherwise, they are in constant anxiety and may go so far as to eat their children to protect them from the anxiety.\n\nThe organism is in an environment. The instinct is always to gain data about the environment to decide whether it is safe. The more a mammal knows about its environment, the safer it feels.\n\nIf it is aware of danger, it retreats to safety. It enters the environment (go outside of safety) to survive (hunt for food, water).\n\nExamples:\n\n- I'm the organism in the FPC 2 cohort. Everyone else is the environment\n- I'm the organism, my team or another department is the environment\n\nEnvironments shift constantly, creating threat.\n\nWhen there's a watering hole, mammals go there for survival. But predators go there too. When the zebra and lion are drinking water, the zebra feels threatened by the lion. The zebra has no choice but to be there.\n\nBut if the zebra knew the lion has just recently eaten, there is some safety.\n\nIf there's a choice, the zebra will never stand next to the lion. But it does so because there's no choice, its needed for survival.\n\nThe zebra cannot change into a lion to survive.\n\nBut _humans can change and become different people_, depending on what container they're in.\n\nIn this analogy, Humans want to be the lion to avoid being eaten but they are unhappy. This is also related to the [[humans.paradoxical-theory-of-change]].\n\nPeople feel safer when there is more information in the environment (related to vulnerability). When someone is angry but it is left unsaid, threat goes up.\n\nBefore going into higher order work (emotions and relationships need to be taken care of first before learning), your primitive brain needs to be taken care of first.\n\n## 3 Types of Environment\n\n1. _Spacial environment_: seating arrangements, building layout etc. Asking 7 people to sit in an inner circle while everyone else forms an outer circle to observe them already causes members of the inner circle to feel unsafe. Other examples: financial environments, organization charts (who gets to talk to who).\n2. _Linguistic environment_: how we judge and assess one another. E.g, culture, policies, what is allowable or not.\n\n   There are many things we could observe linguistically that could make us feel unsafe, but they boil down to these [[humans.systems.linguistic-behaviours-from-lack-of-psychological-safety]]. These behaviours show up when people feel unsafe, which causes a new observer to feel unsafe as well.\n3. _Material environment_: material resource e.g food, sleep, exercise, salary. When these things are not taken care of, it causes people to feel unsafe. Singapore is obsessed with this and is very good at it.\n\n","url":"https://kb.neurrone.com/notes/9a569d67-01fd-4c15-93b0-108a15a78369.html","relUrl":"notes/9a569d67-01fd-4c15-93b0-108a15a78369.html"},{"doc":"Marshaks Table","title":"Marshaks Table","hpath":"humans.systems.marshaks-table","content":"# Marshak's Table\n\nThis is from Marshak's work on covert processes.\n\nCertain things are under, On And Above The Table in conversations.\n\n- _Overt_: this is what goes on the table for discussion because people in the organization assess it to be legitimate or acceptable. This depends on the individuals and the organization.\n- _Covert_: topics that can't be discussed openly are knocked off the table but do not go away. They continue to exist. The 5 places where covert processes manifest are:\n  1. Things outside awareness in prisms (lenses that you view the world) e.g mindsets (socialist vs capitalist)\n  2. emotions, politics and power,, values (what is right or wrong, shaped by our personal experience), psychodynamics\n  3. Things that are unexpressed and above the clouds: inspirations, \"this is too good to ever happen\", tacit beliefs that it is inappropriate to express optimism. Unexpressed due to a fear of ridicule.\n  4. Things that are repressed and buried in the subconscious: deep fears and anxieties, things from childhood, open units of work\n  5.

When someone observes these behaviours, it causes the observer to also feel that same unsafety.\n\n1. _Don't critique_: in the long run, doing this causes you to feel that things are boring / stagnant and that the system is not moving. When avoiding critique, the feeling that nothing moves (which comes from you intrapersonally) gets projected onto the system.\n\n   This comes from the mental script when in survival of not wanting to appear negative and a fear that others think you act with ill intent.\n2. _Don't show weakness_: causes you to feel misunderstood in the long run. If there is pain that is not known to the system, this is a natural outcome.\n\n   This comes from the mental script of not wanting to show weakness to be seen as contributing. \"Since everyone else also experiences pain, suck it up\".\n3. _Don't offer ideas_: causes you to feel insignificant in the long run. Every idea that comes in can be disruptive and break the status quo.\n\n   This is based on the fear of disrupting the system, \"don't want to be the one that shakes things up\" and appear disruptive.\n4. Don't ask questions: causes feelings of helplessness / being unable to affect change in the long run. Knowledge is the beginning of power. Without knowledge, you cannot affect change.\n\n   This comes from the mental script of \"Other people think I should have known. Asking questions means I haven't been paying enough attention and therefore, I appear ignorant or uncaring\". E.g, hearing that someone had a Miscarriage but not wanting to ask about how that person is.\n\n   Not asking questions here is different from not wanting to show weakness (that I did not know).\n\n## Preserving Trust\n\nHumans have a primal fear of not being trusted.\n\nEach of these behaviours is an attempt at wanting to stay in [[humans.trust]] with others.\n\n1. _Don't criticize_: an attempt to maintain trust by sincerity.\n2. _Don't show weakness_: an attempt at preserving trust by competence.\n3. _Don't offer ideas_: an attempt to preserve trust by staying reliable.\n4. _Don't ask questions_: an attempt to preserve care.\n\n---\n\nI personally don't quite understand the last point about preserving care as well as the others.\n","url":"https://kb.neurrone.com/notes/08e659e2-1d95-48f5-85a4-8c18a0b8d694.html","relUrl":"notes/08e659e2-1d95-48f5-85a4-8c18a0b8d694.html"},{"doc":"Intervening In Systems","title":"Intervening In Systems","hpath":"humans.systems.intervention","content":"\n# Intervening In Systems\n\nWe intervene to avert an expected future scenario.

There is choice in the system.\n- _Provoke_: playing the role of an actor. Potential for damage is higher. Can be beneficial. E.g, teachers, military. Bringing a new emotion into the system and hoping that it exposes something buried under the surface. If someone has lots of charisma, they can bring anger into the system even if there is none. Religious leaders can project anger and you own it. There is less choice at this end of the spectrum.\n\nSystems tend towards provocation to move fast.\n\n## Other Things To Note\n\n- _When intervening, always do so with intentionality._\n    Even if there is nothing to say, _there is also value in remaining silent to hold the space with your presence._\n- Intention determines ethics.\n- In clean interventions, we are not agents of change.

No consultant is confronted by all of the issues, but all are plagued by some of them.\n\n- _Feelings_: It gives colour and dimension to our thoughts and actions.\n    Feelings can be powerful, exciting, or disturbing and most of us experience some problems with them - and so, we become unaware of them.\n    When that happens, we compromise our ability to work with clients - e.g aware of subtle, minimal cues, drawing inferences, and doing sensitive hunching.\n- _Self-Esteem & Self-Worth_: Self-esteem refers to positive feelings about self that often are generated by external inputs - rewards, recognition\n\n    Self-worth is rooted in positive feelings that we have for our inner being. We feel good about ourselves. We like what we experience within ourselves. We sense that we are reasonably whole.\n\n    How do we know that we are ok, with or without external input?\n- _Insecurity about Insecurity_: Low self-esteem and low self-worth are often referred to as selfdoubt or insecurity.\n    Having self-doubt is natural, but allowing ourselves to be trapped behind our own facade, hiding our own insecurity from ourselves and others without doing anything with them, that will affect our work.\n- _Blindness to One's Strengths_: Sometimes, by not owning our strengths, we can also be unaware of additional potential strengths within ourselves. By not attributing our success and competency to self, we cannot build on them.\n    We often can not accept praise/recognition in a straightforward way, e.g \"I am so glad you like that.\"\n    We might be readier to share our gaps and deficiencies than our strengths, but when people agree with us, we feel hurt.\n- _Discomfort with Intimacy_: How close can 1 let myself get to this other person?\n    Many factors can get into consultant's preference for or dislike of intimacy, knowing what the factors are can give us a better understanding of ourselves and our choices in our work with others.\n- _Anger_: In many cultures, the experience of anger within a person, and its expression or its control involve frequent challenges for all of us. Many of us are fearful of anger. We either surpassed or deflected our anger. By doing so, we can not come to the root cause of such powerful emotion and hence stop ourselves to gain greater insights on self and others.\n- _Tolerance for Ambiguity_: The need to be in control in the first instance, and the intolerance of ambiguity in the second both impel us toward meeting our own needs, rather than making it possible for the other party to be where they want to be.\n    Being unaware of our own needs, yet unconsciously being driven by them, can lead us to ineffective behaviour.\n    How comfortable are we with the complexity and ambiguity of client interactions?\n- _Awareness of One's Biases_: Seeing accurately is central to a consultant's effectiveness. Much of the work of consultants requires that we accurately perceive the data available to us so that we can act appropriately considering what the data tells us.\n    Data collection and diagnosis - whilst useful and necessary - still need interpretation by the consultant. We are the intermediary between new data and emergent meaning. Our role in making meaning can be distorted by faulty lenses, blind spots, biases, and prejudices. It is this that can be our undoing.\n","url":"https://kb.neurrone.com/notes/2b7c140b-69bf-4027-ae9d-a6f0c4f152a4.html","relUrl":"notes/2b7c140b-69bf-4027-ae9d-a6f0c4f152a4.html"},{"doc":"Differentiation and Integration","title":"Differentiation and Integration","hpath":"humans.systems.differentiation-and-integration","content":"\n# Differentiation And Integration In Human Systems\n\n> In order to fully integrate, we need to first fully differentiate.\n\nIn a situation where everyone in the system has different things they hold dear but no one differentiates from the system by expressing their needs, no one knows what everyone elses needs are.\n\nConsequences:\n\n- Makes it harder to build trust and belonging\n- Prerequisite for [[humans.systems.psychological-safety]] due to [[increased threat|humans.systems.organism-and-environment]]\n\nIn the worst case, not differentiating leads to a negative outcome for everyone instead of a positive outcome for a few.

In FPC 2, this was simulated using groups of 3 - 4.\n- _Total Learning Community (TLC)_: a space where participants come together for dialog and experiential learning. In FPC 2, this was a dialog involving the whole cohort.\n- _Work_: containers where work takes place.\n- _Personal Service Learning (PSL)_: where people find safety, belonging and healing (if the group is sufficiently skilled).\n- Informal containers: typically where conversations involving power and politics take place\n\nDeliberately setting aside containers for such conversations allow issues to be set aside and discussed in the appropriate container when they arise, instead of having to be addressed immediately.\n\nIn my FPC 2 cohort, we did not form PSL groups. This made it very difficult to keep conversations that should be taking place in PSL groups outside conversations in ALGs.\n\n## A Note On Learning Groups\n\nFrom Tong Yee to a past FPC 2 cohort:\n\nJust want to define a few things as people have been asking me about PSLs and how to read up on them etc...\n(Please feel free to copy this into your own cohort chats if you find the distinctions helpful)\n\n1. _Human Interaction Lab (HI Lab)_: This is a week long structure that supports of learning of how diverse individuals interact with one another. It comprises of morning large system check-ins, afternoon classes that give added distinction to support the T-Groups, and evening whole system check-outs, and then typically residential experience where the interaction continues without structure. All data is contributing to learning.\n2. _Training Groups / Sensitivity Groups / Therapy Groups (T-Groups)_: Depending on whether there is a therapist in group (if not they are called Training Groups or Sensitivity Groups), these are small groups systems that typically sits within a structure of a HI Lab. But can also be conducted separately. Sensitivity Groups (Its original name) began as emotional support groups that created a space for specifically men to get in touch with what is going on inside themselves and to work through their units of work. Later on, the model was experienced as very powerful and evolved to become T-Groups and therein non gender specific to extend the learning / training for all. The intention was to develop more facilitators to support the healing of others. Therein Training Groups (T-Groups). Typically T-Groups have no structure and are open learning containers that respond to only what emerges and doesn’t define a modality of learning.\n3. _Action Learning Sets_: In form, these look similar to T-Groups where it is a small group of (6-9) people that gather regularly to learn from each other with minimal intervention from a facilitator or container holder. But unlike T-Groups, action learning sets have ritual or process that provide structure in how each member of a group interact with each other. PSLs are action learning sets. Alcoholic Anonymous is also an Action Learning Set.\n4. _Action Learning Set (Organizational structure) / Community of practice_: This is similar to the above, except the members are typically from a similar sector, industry or shared profession or skill set. Members gather regularly to take turns in working through each other’s issues and problems. They may not necessarily be emotional. Organizations also use this for large systems, to allow for different parts of their typically siloed system to meet and hear from each other’s experience. The model focuses on one person in each set, where each member goes into the full support of that person to better empathize with what they are going through. Over time, taking turns to addressing needs from each person in a system allow for equilibrium to emerge eventually.\n5. _Action Research_: Action research is a process by which change and understanding can be pursued at the one time.  It is usually described as cyclic, with action and critical reflection taking place in turn.  The reflection is used to review the previous action and plan the next one. It is commonly done by a group of people, though sometimes individuals use it to improve their practice.  It has been used often in the field of education for this purpose.  It is not unusual for there to be someone from outside the team who acts as a facilitator. This forms the foundation of Design Thinking today and the philosophy of “just do first and learn along the way”.\n\nEach structure has specific purposes. The distinctions in each container are not meaningless and reap different results.\n\nI used to think they were gobbledegook. But after 5-6 years of this, I have really come to appreciate why the designs hold such intentionality.\n","url":"https://kb.neurrone.com/notes/3450e978-4f2d-4b07-b821-580576653179.html","relUrl":"notes/3450e978-4f2d-4b07-b821-580576653179.html"},{"doc":"Checklist for Intervention","title":"Checklist for Intervention","hpath":"humans.systems.checklist-for-intervention","content":"\n# Checklist For Intervention\n\n1. _Diagnose systems_: data collection. For example, Tong Yee asked FPC 2 participants to do a one word checkout to describe their feelings at the end of each day.\n2. _Create attention_: the system fragments when the intervener doesn't have everyone's attention. E.g, just standing at the front and waiting for conversations to finish creates a choiceful attention in the system. Contrast this with how it is usually done (which feels quite violent).\n3. _Create [[humans.systems.containers]]_: containers are linguistic and are also fiction.\n4. _Establish intention_: an example from FPC 2: \"I'd like you to get into your ALGs. In ALGs, I'd like you to talk about...\". There is also choice for participants to do other things in their ALGs, but this choice must be intentional.\n5. _Give space for resistance_: when you don't give space for resistance, you gain a lot of speed. For Singapore, going from third to first world in a generation came at a price[^1].\n\n   When there are multiple resistances being voiced, periodically reestablish the container.

What is our mission? Objective for the next 5 years? This is missing in Singapore.\n2. _Work_: build competencies, meaning and purpose\n3. _Safety_: when friction and conflict happens in the natural course of diversity, people will complain. The critical thing here is that it fixes nothing. As long as there are others who are also complaining, \"I am right and I feel safe\".\n\n   There is no maturity in this space - maturity comes from perspective. In the online space, these are echo chambers. We have a human need to go there. This is about fitting in.\n\n   E.g, lunch groups at the office\n4. _Healing / belonging_: in the space where safety is found, capabilities need to develop for healing. You can be who you are and belong anyways. If you can see me for who I am and take me anyways, I belong. Contrast this with fitting in above.\n5. _Power and Politics_: this happens after safety if healing does not take place. \"this sucks, want to challenge and change the system\". E.g racial politics. Leads to a desire to change aspirations. What happens when you feel you don't belong. Who gets to decide because this system is not serving me.\n\n   This is not necessarily bad, e.g water cooler conversations.\n\nThe first 2 are on the table, while the rest are typically [[under the table|humans.systems.marshaks-table]].\n\nThere're 2 ways that conversations could go:\n\n1. Aspiration ➡ work ➡ safety ➡ healing\n2. Aspiration ➡ work ➡ safety ➡ power and politics ➡ back to aspiration\n   - When there is safety, there is a tendency to not want to proceed with healing, which always comes with pain. Also requires skill in the system.\n\nExamples:\n\n- A child is not doing homework because the conversation to set up an aspiration that the child then owns is missing. Often, parents proceed to talk about work, skipping the aspiration conversation entirely.\n    This is equally applicable in the work setting - systems are dysfunctional because of lack of aspiration conversations, not due to the work being done. Some things could be assumed, not agreed on.\n- Racial politics and Trump's election campaign are examples of what happens when after safety, healing is not done and there's a desire to redefine aspirations.\n\nIntervening in these factors is done through the appropriate container.\n\n## Psychological Safety\n\nIf people feel unsafe in the system, setting containers for these conversations is one way of creating safety.\n\nFor example, a group of people feel unsafe in a healthcare system due to the disruption caused by covid19. One of the leaders created a smaller group and in that group, everyone committed to \"being there for each other\". Within that group, people could experience abundance and safety. It is fascinating how this linguistic act could cause such a profound change.\n","url":"https://kb.neurrone.com/notes/e6f17cdb-97ea-4d5b-b63f-5d1d076a1966.html","relUrl":"notes/e6f17cdb-97ea-4d5b-b63f-5d1d076a1966.html"},{"doc":"Somatic Archetypes","title":"Somatic Archetypes","hpath":"humans.somatic-archetypes","content":"\n# The 4 Somatic Archetypes\n\nEach of us have a preferred somatic archetype, but it is possible to express the other 3 with practice to build range.

Focused around a central commitment.\n\nPredisposition for action: act decisively, be dutiful, loyal and to succeed\n\nEmotional landscapes accessed: ambition, boldness and bravery, alertness, discipline, tenacity, subjective detached, self-denial for the cause, courage, endurance, dutifulness and loyalty.\n\nExamples: top executives and managers, professional athletes\n\nThis is where conversations for coordinating action come from - organizing people and resources, moving forward with coordinated Action and committed execution. These conversations bring about the tangible achievement of declared goals and desired Results.\n\n## Openness\n\nAlso known as the lover. Opposite of resolution.\n\nIn this stance, one’s gaze is diffused and soft, breathing is through the mouth down to the stomach, and muscular tone is light & supple throughout the body. Energetically your desire is to feel everything and to merge and be one with the universe. The momentum of your energy is moving backward.\n\nYou are concerned about creating, connectedness through feeling and merging in oneness. It is this stance that keeps the other three humane and energized. It is critically important for the well being of self and others.\n\nPredisposition for action: satiate primal hungers, socialize, connect, rest and renew, heal, relate, listen, create, play, seek pleasure, be subjective, daydream, be nostalgic, do nothing in particular, seek meaning… and more.\n\nEmotional landscapes accessed: empathy, intuition, desire, gentleness, enthusiasm, vitality, passion, compassion, longing, sensitivity, sensuality, playfulness, spontaneity, indulgence, addiction, joy, and being romantic about our lives and our goals.\n\nExamples: artists, fictional writers, composers, innovators, and creators... anyone creating through feeling vs. thinking.\n\nThis is where the conversations for relationships come from. Deliberately learning about and connecting with others is the foundation for [[humans.trust]], care and more acceptance when conflicts arise. For example, asking about someone's weekend sincerely in this stance indicates care about people as human beings beyond their position in an organization.\n\n## Stability\n\nAlso known as king / queen.\n\nIn this stance, one’s gaze is towards the infinite, breathing deeply & slowly through the nose to the pelvis, exhaling slowly through the nose, and with a moderate firm muscular tone throughout the body. The momentum of your energy is downwards, firmly rooting you in place.\n\nYou are concerned about order, fertility and blessings. You provide reason and rational operations, integrity, nurturing, generosity, integration and generative energy. Provides reassurance in chaotic situations.\n\nPredisposition for action: provide order, peace and reliability; postpone gratification; facilitate systematic growth; provide nurturing and approval\n\nEmotional landscapes accessed: calmness, subjective detached, dignified, patience, caring and steadiness\n\nExamples: CEOs, parents, athletics coaches\n\nThis is where conversations for context setting and orientation comes from.\n\n## Flexibility\n\nAlso known as magician or jester. Opposite of resolution.\n\nIn this stance, one’s gaze is wide, taking in the entire panorama; breathing is a short and quick inhale through the nose with a long extended exhale through the mouth and a medium muscular tone throughout the body. Energetically you feel ready to solve the mysteries of the universe. The momentum of your energy is going up to your brain, to the sky.\n\nyou are concerned about awareness, illumination, technical skill, and knowledge for the benefit of others. You guide processes of transformation, thinking through issues that are not immediately apparent to others.\n\nPredisposition for action: observe and monitor the data coming from within and without, and through wisdom, push the right buttons at the right time to channel outcomes.\n\nEmotional landscapes accessed: insight, wisdom, subjective detachment, clear sightedness, thoughtfulness, reflection, and objective perspective.\n\nExamples: inventors, scientists, doctors, technicians, lawyers\n\nThis is where conversations of Innovation and Speculation comes from. Involves productively exploring possibilities, alternatives and implications, playing “what if?” and drawing out the unique contributions of all involved.\n\n---\n\nMuch of this explanation is from Language and the Pursuit of Leadership Excellence.\n","url":"https://kb.neurrone.com/notes/5c0f4c84-afad-4a28-9edd-ce81475642ef.html","relUrl":"notes/5c0f4c84-afad-4a28-9edd-ce81475642ef.html"},{"doc":"Psychological Safety Workshop","title":"Psychological Safety Workshop","hpath":"humans.psychological-safety-workshop","content":"\n# Psychological Safety Workshop\n\nThese notes are from the Psychological Safety workshop (now [Power Dynamics and Psychological Safety](https://thethoughtcollective.arlo.co/w/courses/14-power-dynamics-and-psychological-safety)) by The Thought Collective taken on 12 Nov 2020.\n\nUnlike [[humans.fpc2]], this is only a 1 day workshop which assumes no familiarity with FPC material.\n\nBecause psychological safety is related to system work, most of the content introduced overlapped with FPC 2.

This involves changes in an aspect of personality or behaviour. E.g, being better with people, being able to present or facilitate conversations better.\n\nSometimes I succeed, but more often than not I didn't. This was like trying to change into someone that I was not.\n\nAfter I stopped trying so hard to change and as I've done more self-work, I've found it easier to move from the fitting in to the belonging end of the spectrum. That self-work has revealed some answers about who I already am.

We're sincere in what we're asking for\n2. We declare satisfaction when what has been asked for, has been delivered\n\n## Elements Of An Effective Request / Offer\n\nWe make requests all the time. Some requests are more effective - likely to be accepted and lead to better understanding while others breed resentment and misunderstanding. These 6 elements can be helpful for making better requests and listening to requests from others.\n\n1. _Committed speaker_: the speaker puts their body into the request and takes actions to have a committed listener. E.g, making an anonymous request or making a request over your shoulder when passing by someone are not effective.\n2. _Committed listener_: a committed listener is someone who is not otherwise distracted and engaged in doing something else and is giving you their full attention.\n3. _Future actions and condition of satisfaction_: share what you want the listener to do (future action) and the standards that you want the listener to apply while doing it (conditions of satisfaction). Often, what's obvious to one person isn't obvious to another.\n\n   Common reasons why conditions of satisfaction are not spelt out are fear of insulting the listener's intelligence, assuming they already know these details or not having enough time to go into details.\n\n   2 powerful acts to try when concerned about insulting the other person (also useful in other situations) are:\n\n   - Speak directly into your concern about not wanting to insult the other person’s intelligence\n   - Declare yourself a beginner at having the conversation in this way\n\n   For example, \"I’m not entirely sure how to proceed here so let me just share with you what’s going on with me. I want to be specific in requesting your involvement in X, but I have a concern that the way I’m going to ask it is going to insult your intelligence, and that’s not at all what I want. This project is new for me, I haven’t had too many conversations like this, and I really want us to be on the same page with it. Are you okay with me being specific here, even in areas where it may seem obvious, so that we can make doubly sure we’re understanding this in the same way? As uncomfortable as it may be, I think it’ll end up giving us a lot better starting point for moving forward and avoiding misunderstandings later on\"\n\n   Being more precise will be helpful at the beginning of a relationship. As it progresses and a shared background of obviousness is developed, requests can be less detailed.\n\n   Some other reasons for making vague requests are fear of rejection and feeling as if you lack the authority or deserve to make that request. This leads to vague requests with room for interpretation.\n\n   In long-term relationships, you may be able to communicate much with few words due to the shared background of obviousness. But always keep in mind the possibility of being misinterpreted.\n4. _Timeframe_: specify if there is a time the request should be completed by. Sometimes the background of obviousness may fill this in.\n\n   Commonly used terms like \"as soon as possible\", \"promptly\" or \"when you get the chance\" are not effective because there is room for interpretation.\n5. _Mood of the request / offer_: the emotional space of the speaker and listener. The mood of the listener influence how they interpret and respond and the mood of the speaker influences how the request is made.\n\n   > The right conversation in the wrong mood is the wrong conversation.\n6. _Context_: informing the listener of background to understand the request and how it fits into a bigger picture.\n\n## Offers\n\nThe above applies to offers too. Offers are different from requests because they are connected to career and businesses in ways that requests are not.\n\nOffers are made to address some concern. E.g, a business is an ongoing offer to the public which addresses some concern customers have.\n\nQuestions to ponder:\n\n* What is your professional offer to the world? In this lens, a resume is a list of assertions while an offer letter speaks to someone's concerns.\n* Not counting all your acalades, qualifications or experiences, what do you offer to the world? I.e, what would be missing if you were no longer around?\n\n## Not Requesting Because \"it should be obvious\"\n\nProfessionally and personally, we may be in situations when we don't make a request because \"I shouldn't have to ask you that\" because the other person should already know or this is just common sense.\n\nThis is an example of the choice to be right vs being happy. From a position of right-ness where we shouldn't have to ask you to do that, not making request does not lead to the desired result. This causes resentment and we continue to find fault with the other person. Or we can make the request to produce the desired result and operate from the work / doesn't work orientation and find some degree of happiness.\n","url":"https://kb.neurrone.com/notes/0dcc070e-45c9-4783-85e1-885ce9d2166d.html","relUrl":"notes/0dcc070e-45c9-4783-85e1-885ce9d2166d.html"},{"doc":"Promises","title":"Promises","hpath":"humans.language.promises","content":"\n# Promises\n\nThe fabric of society and the economy is held together by promises (AKA agreements or commitments) between individuals and organizations. E.g, an employer promising to pay someone for work done.\n\nThe [[effectiveness of the request|humans.language.requests-and-offers]] affects how clear both parties are about what exactly has been promised. Ineffective requests could cause both parties to have different interpretations about what exactly has been promised.\n\nPromises change the world the instant they are made, not just by their fulfillment. The other person makes different choices because of the promise. Language communicates commitment, not just information.\n\nWhen keeping or breaking a promise, it affects:\n\n- Trust\n- Relationships\n- Success\n- Self-esteem\n\nWhen keeping a promise, all of these elements go up (or down when breaking a promise) for the parties at both ends.\n\nHow well you manage your commitments has a huge impact on public identity.\n\n## Angle Of Inauthenticity\n\nThe angle of authenticity (i.e, the BS angle) is the difference between:\n\n- What I say I will do, what I say I will say\n- What I actually do, what I actually say\n\nIn this analogy, whether we keep our promises is the amount of bullshit we're producing. People have good BS detectors.\n\n## Types Of Promises\n\n1. _Strong promises_: promises that you're committed to keeping. You can count on me.\n2. _Shallow promise_: like strong promises, but with an unsaid \"unless x or y happens\". There is a private out for ourselves that the other person doesn't know.\n3. _Criminal promises_: promises we have no intention of keeping at the moment when they are made.\n\nAs an exercise, think about the various types of promises you make in various domains (work, friends and to yourself).\n\nLow self-esteem is closely related to promises. We often make criminal promises to ourselves. The broken promises live on in us, which affects moods and results.\n\n## Managing Commitments\n\nNo one is perfect, so there will be situations where you can't keep a promise made in good faith due to e.g circumstances out of your control.\n\nManaging these commitments by letting the other person know that you can't keep it as soon as possible lets them make alternate arrangements or renegotiate the promise. Not managing this well has obvious effects on the relationship and your public identity.\n\nWe can't keep every promise we make, but can take responsibility to manage all of them.\n\nSingle promises are often linked with other promises. Your ability to deliver on a promise might depend on someone else keeping their promise to you. Likewise, the other party being able to deliver promises to others depends on you keeping your promise.\n\nCommitments are also not made in isolation - often on top of existing commitments. The other person doesn't know about the 20 other commitments you're juggling, just that you made a promise to them.\n\nThis causes people to be overwhelmed. Time management books try to address this but improvements are often not sustained in the long term.\n\nThere is no such thing as time management: time doesn't stop. We can management commitments, not time.\n\n[[Saying no|humans.language.declarations]] is extremely important to manage commitments to avoid others running your life. It may not be easy, but it is worth it.\n\n### Requests Vs Demands In Organizations\n\nIn organizations, there will be legitimate situations where saying no is not an option. This would be a demand. Being employed means you agree to say yes in such situations.\n\nHowever, there is a boundary between these requirements and requests. Its often the case where the person making the request views them as requests while the other party views them as demands with no room for declining or negotiation.\n\nIt may be useful to have a conversation to clarify what are requests vs demands.\n\n### Responsible Complaints\n\nNot dealing with broken promises usually leads to resentment, decline in the relationship and less productivity and effectiveness when working together. To manage an unfulfilled promise when you're on the receiving end, initiate a responsible complaint.\n\nA responsible complaint is a conversation where the recipient of the broken promise initiates a conversation with the other party[^1] to take care of the broken promise in a way that maintains or even strengthens the relationship.\n\nResponsible complaints are only applicable when there has been a broken promise, not when someone doesn't meet an (usually unspoken) expectation.\n\nPromises unkept are NOT equal to expectations unmet.\n\nStart by having a conversation about responsible complaints - where people working together discuss commitments and managing commitments, as well as the negative consequences of having promises go unkept and unmanaged. Participants in this conversation give each other permission to call each other on unmet commitments. Share concerns with being beginners and not \"getting it right\" and \"hurting feelings\" which are valid concerns. This sets the context in which a responsible complaint has the best chance of success.\n\nTo make a responsible complaint:\n\n1. Start with assertions. Clarify with the other person whether the promise existed in the first place, and whether the promise did or did not get fulfilled.\n2. If the promise was made and has indeed not been kept, declare the unacceptability of this happening again. Share assessments of negative consequences that occurred. Request that promises in the future are managed by doing X or Y.\n3. Make a new request with a new time frame and obtain a promise to take care of what needed to be taken care of.\n\n### Responding To Requests\n\nWhen trying to create a culture of commitment and personal ownership and responsibility for managing promises, these responses to requests are not effective:\n\n- I'll try\n- Maybe / possibly / perhaps / we'll see\n- Silence (no response)\n\nInstead, the conversation should end with one of these 4 responses to a request:\n\n- _Yes_: acceptance, so we have a promise\n- _No_: decline, so we don't have a promise\n- _Commit to commit_: a promise to get back to the requester at a specified time with an answer\n- _Counter-offer_: a decline of the initial request with its conditions and an offer to accept if some conditions are changed. \"I can't get it done by Fri, would Mon work?\"\n\nThese responses are all clear and not fuzzy. Its a clean interaction where everyone knows what's going to happen.\n\n## Commitments In Organizations\n\nOrganizations can be viewed as a web of promises - nested cycles of commitment which are connected to one another.\n\nIn an organization where promises are not met and allowed to slide, unspoken assumptions and responsibility not being taken to manage commitments, there is lots of blaming others and excuses about why things are not done.\n\nIn an organization where commitments are made publicly and most people manage their commitments and take them seriously, there is much less unexpected drops of the ball as people are often communicating with others and renegotiating commitments. Everyone expects commitments to be kept and managed. Anyone failing to manage a commitment will be called out on it by peers or subordinates not in a accusing way, but one consistent with a culture of trust, responsibility and teamwork. This is agreed upon in advance.\n\n---\n\n[^1]: I've observed that the person which broke a promise to us is often the last person that we talk to. Instead, we complain to anyone else behind their backs, which is often unproductive.\n","url":"https://kb.neurrone.com/notes/c1f34d98-fd62-4d56-86f9-c18f90457ba6.html","relUrl":"notes/c1f34d98-fd62-4d56-86f9-c18f90457ba6.html"},{"doc":"Declarations","title":"Declarations","hpath":"humans.language.declarations","content":"# Declarations\n\nWith [[humans.language.assertions]], first comes the world, then the word. With declarations, the word comes first, and the world follows.\n\nDeclarations are a speech act where the speaker creates new possibilities and a new way of seeing things from nothingness. They don't depend on the existing world but bring a new world into existence. Declarations generate our reality. E.g, my reality is \"I had a bad day\".\n\nDeclarations are also highly connected to moods and emotions. E.g, the PM of Singapore declaring that \"Singapore is behind all foreign workers\" would have been political suicide usually, but the declaration landed very well in Covid19. Leaders may need to wait for the appropriate time for the right mood / emotion so that their declaration lands.\n\nWe take 4 primary actions with declarations:\n\n1. _Open or initiate_: e.g declaring a country into being, creating a new organization, initiating a new relationship by introducing yourself, \"i don't know\" opens a space for learning to happen, \"I'm grateful for\" makes joy and contentment possible\n2. _Close or conclude_: an apology closes a chapter and opens a new one, \"I forgive you\" concludes an event and closes the accompanying resentment. \"Thank you\" declares satisfaction with your fulfillment of a promise to me, \"You're fired\", \"this relationship is over\"\n3. _Resolve_: judgments from a judge or jury resolves questions of guilt or innocence (regardless of what actually happened), yes/no (every decision is a declaration)\n4. _Evaluate (with assessments)_: [[humans.language.assessments]] are a type of declaration.\n\nDeclarations can be valid or invalid. Whether it is valid depends on whether the person making the declaration has authority granted by the community to do so. E.g, a priest declaring someone married changes the world in a way that a random person on the street going through the same motions cannot.\n\nSocially, the expectations around declarations are:\n\n1. The speaker does have the authority to make that declaration (i.e, [[humans.systems.power]] and [[humans.trust]])\n2. The speaker acts in a way consistent with their declaration\n\n## Declarations Create Context\n\nContext is that that surrounds the text, or the environment against which something is interpreted.\n\nDeclarations also create context which affects how future events are interpreted. E.g watching TV at 10PM (the content / event / fact) after your parents created context by declaring \"no more TV after 9PM\" causes that event to be interpreted differently.\n\nIt is powerful to notice and do this consciously.\n\nCreating the right context is also critical for leadership. When declarations create this nonphysical environment, this environment is the mood or culture of a relationship, family, organization or nation. Hence, successful leadership requires creating and sustaining a certain context (and not another).\n\nSuccessful relationships are built on conversations where we share our views, come to mutual understanding and make mutual declarations about we we're committed to bring forth and how we're committed to be with each other.\n\nConversations for setting and sharing contexts are often missing in personal and professional situations.\n\n## Key Declarations\n\n### Yes and No\n\nSaying yes commits you to an action, opening new possibilities and closing others. Likewise with saying no.\n\nEvery decision is a declaration.\n\nSaying no can often be difficult, because we often equate no with rejection of the other person. Likewise, others saying no to you is often seen as a rejection of you.\n\nThe inability to say no is connected to our power and dignity. This is an example where not being able to say a certain thing (\"No\") = not being able to be a certain way (assertive, designing my life, with dignity).\n\nNot being able to say no likely leads to being overcommitted (committing to do doing 10 things when you've already agreed to do 15 other tasks). This leads to feeling overwhelmed and stressed.\n\nA more powerful interpretation to adopt is saying no is simply declining a request - the person and the request are separate. Saying no is just declining of the request, not a rejection of the other person.\n\n### I Don't know\n\nI don't know is often interpreted as I am stupid / don't care / don't want to know etc.\n\nAnother interpretation is that I'm available for learning. Ignorance is not the opposite of learning, it is where learning starts.\n\nI don't know creates a new context for learning. How much learning happens when teaching someone who already thought they knew it?\n\nConversations about learning could be missing - granting ourselves and others to be a beginner at something and how to bring learning about.\n\n### I apologize\n\nLinguistically takes care of a relationship by acknowledging mistakes and broken commitments. It closes a chapter and opens a new one and heals the relationship.\n\nWhen promises have not been kept and no apologies are issued, that has an effect on the relationship moving forward. E.g, leaders in organizations who do this create a mood of resentment and cynicism.\n\nEveryone makes mistakes, so this declaration can surely serve us personally and professionally.\n\n### I Forgive You\n\nSee [[humans.language.declarations.forgiveness]].\n\n### Thank you\n\nThank you is an acknowledgement of another's kindness or contribution. Can be seen as a declaration of acceptance that closes a transaction (usually a promise or an agreement)\n\nThank you can also greatly influence mood. The mood of joy is connected to the mood of gratitude. E.g, try imagining someone who is joyful not being grateful for something.\n\nHence, we can consciously move towards joy by learning how to declare [[humans.language.declarations.gratitude]].\n\n### I Love You\n\n> One of the most interesting ways of looking at love that I’ve ever heard is from Humberto Maturana, the pioneering Chilean neurobiologist. His definition of love is: The radical acceptance of the other as a legitimate other in co-existence with me.\n>\n> The focus is on our declaration of acceptance and of legitimacy. We declare our acceptance of another human being as being “legitimate” in his or her co-existence with us. To me, the words “true and equal partner” come to mind. Think about the implications of such a declaration. Declaring such a context, to me, immediately brings about a space of mutual respect and acceptance. It also allows space for us to make requests of each other, and maintain flexibility and openness in designing how we do what we do together.\n\nConsider a relationship where \"I love you\" is never said. Thinking it is very different from saying it. Saying it builds the relationship and sets context.\n\nWho are the loved ones in your life who you've not said this to? Why not?\n\n### I Am ...\n\nThis is a declaration of who we say are in the world (our identity). This is a primary declaration and is at the heart of ontological coaching.\n\nA lot of suffering is caused by operating out of primary declarations that aren't conducive to the actions and moods needed to achieving the results we want.\n\nThese root declarations are usually invisible and hard to see. We see ourselves repeating the same mistakes over and over again. This is where a coach comes in and helps the coachee see these underlying interpretations for what they are (not the truth) and how that influences their actions. The coachee can then invent and declare new ones.\n\nFor example, \"I am shy\". If this is viewed as a permanent fixture of who you are, then change is unlikely. For example, at a dance it is unlikely someone who says they're shy would ask someone for a dance. If the declaration is held as the truth, it paralyzes and limits possibilities for designing something different.\n\nBut if shy is viewed as an assessment and you declare yourself a beginner at dancing, you can learn and through practice, build competence.\n\nWe tend to make up stories which disempowers us.\n\n### This Is Not Working...\n\n> Here’s a great way to understand whether or not a breakdown has occurred: If you hear yourself suddenly say “oh shit,” rest assured that in almost every case, a breakdown is present! Not all breakdowns begin with such a salute, but many do.\n\nThis points to a breakdown - an unexpected break in the normal flow of our lives. Breakdowns are unexpected interruptions in the fulfillment of a commitment. Almost everything we do is related to the fulfillment of a commitment - we live in a web of commitments.\n\nWhen breakdowns happen, we no longer operate in transparency - e.g, being on \"autopilot\" when driving home. The break in transparency is a moment of choice, to consciously choose how to proceed towards the desired result.\n\n- The universe doesn't have breakdowns, people do. Different observers have different breakdowns. A huge breakdown by one person may pass unnoticed by another due to each having different distinctions\n- Breakdowns just are - they are not good or bad\n- Breakdowns may happen to us, or we can declare breakdowns into being\n- We can declare the status quo to be a breakdown. In organizations, this depends on the type of breakdown and our authority. We can declare any aspect of our personal lives a breakdown, which is often the first step for change or learning\n- Declaring a breakdown sets a new context for action\n- Breakdowns are inevitable, the point is not to avoid them. it is to gain competency and ability to deal effectively with the breakdowns which occur, as well as to gain practice in declaring breakdowns proactively as a way of moving ourselves toward the results we say we want\n- We address our breakdowns through conversations. Conversations need to move beyond assessing what happened to a promise or commitment to take new action to resolve the breakdown.\n","url":"https://kb.neurrone.com/notes/732938aa-de7d-43da-b8cf-a2ee07ad6b24.html","relUrl":"notes/732938aa-de7d-43da-b8cf-a2ee07ad6b24.html"},{"doc":"Gratitude","title":"Gratitude","hpath":"humans.language.declarations.gratitude","content":"\n# Gratitude\n\nDeclaring gratitude is connected to joy and peace.\n\nTODO: expand on this more\n\n## Practicing Gratitude\n\nHere are some things I've learned about practicing gratitude.\n\n1. I suggest starting first by writing down something you're grateful for each day.\n\n   Its true that you can declare gratitude about anything, but doing so risks making the exercise feel mechanical especially when first learning how to practice gratitude.\n\n   Instead, wait for the thing you feel grateful for to come to you. You'll know if its right when you resonate with it.\n2. We tend to think about all the things that we are not happy about and wish to change. And it feels as if the list of things that we can be grateful for is dwarfed by all the things we are unhappy about.\n\n   But I realized there really is also an equally long list of things that we can be grateful for.\n\n   The list of things we dislike and want to change just seems a lot longer because that's what we've practiced noticing.\n\n   Hence, the practice of gratitude is about learning how to recognize what we already have and will receive, to learn how to make new assessments.\n\n   Gratitude really is a choice.\n3. The real test is to practice gratitude even in situations that seem incompatible with feeling grateful.\n\n   For example, I feel grateful for my anger at xyz because it allows me to recognize when my boundaries have been violated. I am grateful for sadness, which stands witness and shows me what I've lost.\n4. Gratitude doesn't make \"difficult\" emotions go away. But it is a reminder of what you do have.\n","url":"https://kb.neurrone.com/notes/5d33147d-a884-487f-baec-cf5c3a3742a7.html","relUrl":"notes/5d33147d-a884-487f-baec-cf5c3a3742a7.html"},{"doc":"Forgiveness","title":"Forgiveness","hpath":"humans.language.declarations.forgiveness","content":"\n# Forgiveness\n\n> Forgiveness is directly connected to moving out of resentment and designing some peace within our lives. This powerful language act – the declaring of forgiveness – is central to our ability to close previous chapters and begin new ones. It may be the most powerful language act available to those of us seeking the experience of happiness, the experience of peacefulness in our lives.\n\nForgiveness is a powerful [[declaration|humans.language.declarations]] which lets a chapter close and another one open. In this context, the other person may not know / need to know about the declaration of forgiveness.\n\nHere, forgiveness is not for the other person. It is for the one who is suffering.\n\nForgiveness is a declaration in which we say:\n\n1. What you have done to me caused me harm and damaged my possibilities.\n2. I do not condone this, and I do not give you permission to do this again.\n3. I choose to forgive you, to let go of these conversations. I now will focus my attention and my awareness in other areas, rather than continuing to live in these conversations about you and about what you did. I choose to move forward with my life.\n4. I revoke my promise to somehow, some way, get you back.\n5. I choose to move into some peace and out of this resentment.\n\nForgiveness is a choice. However, you can't declare to never remember something. However, you can choose how you respond when you do remember.\n\nForgiveness can also bring dignity, self-worth and self-acceptance.\n\n## Barriers To Forgiveness\n\n- I'm right\n- They don't deserve to be forgiven\n- To forgive is to condone what they did\n- Forgiveness is a sign of weakness\n- To forgive means I'll forget, and I'll never forget\n- I want them to suffer, so I'll never forgive\n- Forgiving lets them off the hook\n\nThe focus is not on whether these interpretations are right or wrong, but on the actions and results they lead - that forgiveness will likely not occur, so the benefits of forgiveness are not available too.\n\n## Pain And Suffering\n\n> pain is biological, but suffering is linguistic.\n>\n> I don’t need to have pain in order to suffer, and I can have pain without the suffering. Forgiveness deals directly with the suffering. The single most powerful tool that I have discovered for designing well-being in my life is the declaration of forgiveness. It applies to my work and social life as well as my home life. A great many people in our workshops report the exact same thing.\n\n## When Forgiveness Is Premature\n\nIn some settings, people are encouraged to forgive without being truly ready for it.\n\nWhen forgiveness is premature, the underlying pain is often not dealt with, causing a split with the part of the self that still carries that pain. This pain will resurface eventually.\n\nInstead, it is healthier to allow the pain to carry us to forgiveness once we've worked our way through it.\n\n---\n\nQuotes and most of the content here are from Language and the Pursuit of Happiness.\n","url":"https://kb.neurrone.com/notes/1072a2fa-9175-4a2b-bd4f-767adca9be31.html","relUrl":"notes/1072a2fa-9175-4a2b-bd4f-767adca9be31.html"},{"doc":"Assessments","title":"Assessments","hpath":"humans.language.assessments","content":"\n# Assessments\n\n> Assertions have to do with what is so. Assessments have to do with what is possible.\n>\n> Julio Olalla\n\nAssessments are also [[humans.language.declarations]].\n\nAn assessment is a speech act where the speaker defines how he/she relates to the world or an event. For example, good vs bad, right vs wrong etc. The speaker takes a stand on something.\n\n- Assessments are highly generative and creative.\n- No third party may either prove an assessment true or false, as they are personal judgments from different observers out of different standards, beliefs, moods and experiences.\n- Assessments belong to the observer and not what is being observed. Assessments often reveal more about the observer than the subject being observed.\n    The room is spacious or cramped is an assessment that belongs to each individual observer, and not to the thing being observed. Whether a room is cramped or spacious depends on who's looking.\n- Assessments have everything to do with the future, and can be viewed as \"stepping stones\" toward the future. If you assess someone as unreliable and there is an opening for your team, you will not choose that person. The assessment of unreliable in the present influences the future choice to not select them.\n- Assessments are highly influenced by moods and emotions. You will react differently to missing your bus when you are joyful vs frustrated.\n- Socially, we are expected to have some [grounds for making our assessments](#grounded-assessments) and are not just conjuring them from thin air.\n- We make assessments against standards which are often unspoken. E.g, Bob has been late 3 times leads to the assessment that Bob is unreliable, if the standard is say not being late more than twice. This assessment would affect whether Bob is chosen for a new team.\n    There is a social aspect to assessments. We adopt many of these standards through our upbringing or the community, often without consciously choosing to do so.\n    Standards are historical and can shift over time. E.g, what is considered old has changed in the past century due to medical advances.\n    There is nothing wrong about having different standards. However, standards are often hidden and not discussed, as such conversations are often missing.\n- Most people use the word opinions to describe assessments. The key difference between opinions and assessments in this context is assessments influence how we interpret future information, as we tend to only notice things that fit into our assessments so that we are right. For example, noticing every time someone is late, but not when they are on time.\n\nContrast this with [[humans.language.assertions]].\n\n## Assertions Vs Assessments\n\nIt is critical to make the distinction between assertions and assessments. This may sound obvious, but we often forget this and hold our assessments as the complete truth, especially regarding beliefs about ourselves. We often use them in the same way when thinking and speaking.\n\nPeople who live as if their assessments were assertions usually create a public identity of being stubborn, opinionated etc.\n\nAssessments may always be revised. This is very powerful when looking at assessments about ourselves that are not serving us in getting the results we say we want in our lives. Instead of viewing them through the right / wrong lens, do our assessments work / not work for us?\n\n## Who Do You Grant Authority To Assess You?\n\n- Who do you give the authority to assess you?\n- In what domains?\n\nIf you don't grant anyone authority to assess you in any domain, it shows up as not allowing anyone to share their authentic experience of you, which could be very valuable.\n\nIt does not have to be an all or nothing answer. Your boss may have the authority to assess you on your work performance, but not your choice of hobby.\n\nin personal situations we often give those closest to us great permission and latitude in assessing us, even in domains in which they may not be competent to do so. Thus, \"I love you and I give you permission to define who I am.\"\n\n## Grounded Assessments\n\nWe are assessment machines and assess all the time. This is not inherently bad, it just is.\n\nAssessments show up everywhere in our lives. Being better at producing more grounded assessments - assessments consciously connected to facts, behaviours and standards - allows us design the lives we want.\n\n1. Clarify to yourself why you're making the assessment e.g for some future interaction? If there isn't a reason, then this is a recreational assessment that can't be grounded. We can have recreational assessments, just that they're ungroundable.\n2. Clarify the standards you're using in the assessment. Requires consciously noticing the standards that you set.\n3. Come up with actions or events (assertions) to support the assessment. Is this first-hand information? Be careful about using assessments to ground other assessments - you can't use being sloppy to ground the assessment of being unreliable.\n4. Come up with assertions that support the opposite assessment. If so, what does this mean?\n5. Ground the assessment with other people, especially the way that you connected assertions to assessment. This is not about trying to get others to agree with you. Maintain a mode of openness and inquiry in this conversation, as this can be one way to build trust and lay a foundation for solid relationships. It can also be an excellent source of feedback about the effectiveness and consequences of using our current standards.\n\n## Event Does Not Equal Explanation\n\nWe create stories all the time to explain or make sense of events - it is just in our nature. It isn't bad. But after we create those explanations, we forget that these are stories we created and view these explanations as the truth.\n\nThe event of failing a test is very different from the explanation or assessment being made of it of \"I am stupid\".\n\nThe question is not whether your story is right or wrong. Rather, is your story working for you given the results you say you want? If not, you can always learn to author more powerful stories that will serve you better in designing the life you want.\n","url":"https://kb.neurrone.com/notes/86c2c093-d948-4a9b-844a-0900d2816b39.html","relUrl":"notes/86c2c093-d948-4a9b-844a-0900d2816b39.html"},{"doc":"Assertions","title":"Assertions","hpath":"humans.language.assertions","content":"\n# Assertions\n\nAn assertion is a speech act where the speaker establishes the facts of life - what is true or false for the speaker and listener.

These strategies shut you off from your emotions for your own safety.\n\nHowever, this becomes a mood if left unchecked for too long.\n\n- _Apathy_: turning off your emotions when there is too much pain. It is unlikely that someone is not feeling anything, they are more likely hurt and choose to shut down to protect themselves.\n- _Indifference_: selectively turning off emotions for particular things. This allows focus on things that matter, but be careful of it becoming a mood.\n- _Cynicism_: cynics are first idealists. they are eventually disappointed and they stay resigned. cynics tend to make other people feel resigned as well so that they themselves do not have to try again.\n    The skeptic is  earnestly trying to grow but is just being cautious.

Therefore, the responsibility of that decision is no longer theirs and is instead pushed to the person which provided that advice.\n\nIn other words, confusion happens when someone is not ready to step into an identity.\n\n---\n\nThanks Wynn for this summary.\n","url":"https://kb.neurrone.com/notes/b497e0c1-d62b-4dc5-b746-c8001f685263.html","relUrl":"notes/b497e0c1-d62b-4dc5-b746-c8001f685263.html"},{"doc":"Cycle of Experience","title":"Cycle of Experience","hpath":"humans.cycle-of-experience","content":"\n# Cycle of Experience\n\nTLDR: taking care of unfinished business.\n\nIn Gestalt theory, stress and problems with human functioning happen when people get stuck in the various stages of the cycle of experience, unable to complete their cycle.\n\nA unit of work is a complete experience such as the completion of a task, resolution of a problem or a learning experience. When there is an incomplete unit of work, there is resistance somewhere along this cycle of experience that prevents the work from completing. Energy is released and available for other units of work only when the cycle of experience is complete.\n\nThis appears to be related to the needs satisfaction cycle, but it uses slightly different terminology.\n\n![The Cycle of Experience described below](../assets/images/cycle-of-experience-9f655f1f-3b85-4866-ac2c-5e7ae024e519.jpg)\n\nWe have many needs and cycles of experience going at once, and we can interrupt this cycle, preventing that need from being met. The indented items are resistances happening between each stage of the cycle of experience that prevent us from proceeding further along the cycle.\n\n1. _Sensation_: something figural happens that disturbs the individual from the steady state. E.g, feeling that my throat is dry.\n   - _Desensitization_: this happens before reaching awareness. The person who is desensitizing does not even become aware of the need. Often occurs as a result of abuse. E.g, feeling nothing when someone shouts at you.\n2. _Awareness_: awareness of sensation causes the need to do something e.g I need a drink of water\n   - _Deflection_: excuses that you use to deflect the need, e.g changing topics in a conversation or making a joke\n3. _Mobilization of Energy_: committing to satisfying that need and getting ready to take action\n   - _Introjection_: all the should nots, excuses and justifications that we use to avoid taking action\n4. _Action_: taking an action to satisfy that need\n   - _Projection_: this happens before reaching contact. Projecting your thoughts onto other people, guessing how they think or feel.\n       This is also where you try to rescue others by getting them to engage in units of work that you yourself have not completed. For example, the regret from not expressing your feelings for a loved one who passed away causes you to nag others to do so for their own loved ones. The desire to rescue others can be prevented by doing your own self-work to establish healthy boundaries so you know what units of work is yours, and which can only be done by others.\n   - _Retroflection_: working against our need and redirecting the contact to ourselves instead. E.g, using porn\n5. _Contact_: when the need is met\n   - _Egotism_: refusing to be satisfied by making it about yourself. e.g i was praised but i resisted the satisfaction by saying they don't really know what kind of person i am\n6. _Satisfaction_: satisfaction that the need is met\n   - _Confluence_: your work is done, but because of others, you can't leave. e.g i'm no longer depressed but my best friend is, i cant say i am not because it will be leaving him\n7. _Withdrawal_: letting go for a new sensation to arise\n\n## Resistances Are Not Always Negative\n\nResistances can also be a form of intervention. To end sexual harassment, the would-be perpetrator should use introjection to curb the impulse. To improve mental health, use desensitization and ignore the news.\n\nSome amount of resistances is also normal and healthy. We would be overwhelmed without resistances which prevents us from being able to process too many units of work simultaneously. It is also a critical mechanism for survival and well-being.\n\n* * *\n\nThanks Wynn for this summary.\n\n## References\n\n- [Gestalt Cycle of Experience](http://www.clevelandconsultinggroup.com/articles/gestalt-cycle-of-experience.php)\n- See this [video on the cycle of experience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZyF0JsyreM).
