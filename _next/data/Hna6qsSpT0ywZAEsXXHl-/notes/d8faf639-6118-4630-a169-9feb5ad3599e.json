This involves changes in an aspect of personality or behaviour. E.g, being better with people, being able to present or facilitate conversations better.</p>\n<p>Sometimes I succeed, but more often than not I didn't. This was like trying to change into someone that I was not.</p>\n<p>After I stopped trying so hard to change and as I've done more self-work, I've found it easier to move from the fitting in to the belonging end of the spectrum. That self-work has revealed some answers about who I already am. Doing things consistent with that is much easier, effortless even as I learn to act from congruence.</p>\n<p>In that process of letting go and discovering what I already am, I have found that I have changed a lot - paradoxically, this only happened when I became who I already am.</p>\n<h2 id=\"references\">References<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#references\"></a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.clevelandconsultinggroup.com/articles/paradox-theory-of-change.php\">Paradox: A Gestalt Theory </a>: the paradoxical theory of change is central to the practice of Gestalt theory.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.gestalt.org/arnie.htm\">Paradoxical Theory of Change</a>: the paradoxical theory of change from the theraputic perspective.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<strong>Backlinks</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/notes/9a569d67-01fd-4c15-93b0-108a15a78369\">Organism and Environment (Human Dynamics)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/notes/d650289d-5586-446b-80fa-a4f3f8c22f4f\">Systems and Gestalt Theory (Human Dynamics)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/notes/fe7da096-d4d5-43fb-83e0-91fc9d49de85\">Why Things Are (Human Dynamics)</a></li>\n</ul>","noteIndex":{"id":"root","title":"root","desc":"","updated":1622102326440,"created":1595961348801,"stub":false,"custom":{"stub":false,"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"name":"main","fsPath":"main","useFMTitle":false},"contentHash":"2222728f026e86e75d06a6048c4f43ed","links":[],"anchors":{"personal-knowledge-base":{"type":"header","text":"Personal Knowledge Base","value":"personal-knowledge-base","line":9,"column":0,"depth":1}},"children":["9fa47ef8-a44b-4e36-929f-4aa7835b474d","6e43ea37-b3e7-44cf-aac7-31ae947d32a2","a10a1802-11d0-4557-a374-89712109cf90","0b9beaed-19ee-4124-a880-07e520da2b17","ddf3e9b2-ea12-4129-8785-06d6b82d4fcb","k6cqa8os92v51eze0j04mb4","5uawuvtmz4i2p2pixnjt11r","b4be93a8-69e3-4427-b4cd-53593c3ab387","5bbec2d1-4abe-4a2a-8bc5-5f3d4e229766","4a064a97-3d2d-4429-9a08-5b158dc7ef35","543e830d-feac-4048-8075-58c406bc1105","8875d2cf-85f8-41e8-b16d-c3707e40d74e","4k2ot7nwcxbum3rwhovp8bp","8ec37b11-59ad-4ea8-82d9-3186e7e0cd29","dOehc8Yap1zIbEqLvQvOt","b58269ed-9a0e-4213-b5b0-6d59c81d9899","b4fc6d48-17ae-4764-acdb-ec0f52707860","091b67bf-8bfa-454c-bbd3-7d84d8216229","f6fbee87-be27-471c-99bd-4af45d6a3156","fb9e4130-eaf8-425d-9039-5bc2ee876f18","4fb536a9-c146-4df3-8f30-9b2fb52a77f7","4cwalqweyykqziy3znsqelc","jdry0g5gsm21oeh2gjpt54c","21ef758d-ca84-4be0-8eed-5e95ab3b4a7e","5fb5baa9-8b3d-4044-9c03-bbabfbdfe78a","2f6af89e-df82-4144-87fc-a2be66a0e657","POgyWcSIqi29tpqfP5uyS","525uy1b41n5r1x0n5oi5sio","xatnqhj9qnxdl566mjnlff7","7twamkimwx3wj3sdlczyq14","oeqmuhce91oauikgau9rein","myv8v33xzirkeimiwour3qr","nevf177bncffcpizdc3do93","dmxo1bboqff7qo7w1uazj5n","78orqnwylqsz3vaa16sqg3b","kehuh3ur8fbjlftqclu2c9h"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"\n# Personal Knowledge Base\n\nHi, and welcome to [Dickson Tan's](https://neurrone.com/pages/about/) personal knowledge base.\n\nThis is an experiment in note taking with the Zettelkasten method.
