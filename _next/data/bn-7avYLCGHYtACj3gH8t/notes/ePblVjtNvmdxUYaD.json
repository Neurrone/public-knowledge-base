It is something that anyone can attain with enough effort.</p>\n<p>Learning any new skill involves making some progress, followed by a slight decline to a plateau (usually higher than the previous plateau). Most of the time will be spent on a plateau, practicing even when it seems to be going nowhere.</p>\n<h2 id=\"taking-shortcuts\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#taking-shortcuts\"></a>Taking Shortcuts</h2>\n<p>The master's journey is long and rocky, so we sometimes look for other paths.</p>\n<p>These categorizations aren't always as neat as described. Even in the same field, you can sometimes be on the path to mastery, at other times an obsessive.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-dabbler\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#the-dabbler\"></a>The Dabbler</h3>\n<p>The dabbler is very enthusiastic with starting the new career, learning the new sport or starting a new relationship. The dabbler enjoys the rituals of getting started: the new equipment, the shine of newness. He or she is overjoyed with the initial progress, e.g showing off in a new sport to friends.</p>\n<p>The fall from the first peak and the plateau that follows is unacceptable. The dabbler starts making excuses about why the skill isn't right (e.g, the sport is too competitive / not right etc) and starts missing lessons and telling everyone else the excuses.</p>\n<p>Starting something new is an opportunity to replay that scenario.</p>\n<p>In careers, the dabbler has a lengthy resume. In relationships, the dabbler specializes in honeymoons.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-obsessive\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#the-obsessive\"></a>The Obsessive</h3>\n<p>To the obsessive, quick results are what matters and it doesn't matter how he or she gets them. The obsessive wants to perfect the stroke after the first class, stays after class to talk to the instructor and gets books to help learn the skill more quickly.</p>\n<p>The obsessive makes good progress at first, but the inevitable plateau is unacceptable. He or she puts in even more effort and takes shortcuts to get quick results, or does all nighters. The burnout leads to a sharp decline and a jagged fall, hurting not just the obsessive about others around them in the process.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-hacker\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#the-hacker\"></a>The Hacker</h3>\n<p>The hacker doesn't mind skipping stages needed to develop mastery. After making some initial progress, the hacker doesn't mind staying on a plateau indefinitely. The hacker is the employee that doesn't develop professionally, does just enough to get by and wonders why he or she isn't getting promoted.</p>\n<hr>\n<strong>Backlinks</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/notes/So0IQK5CtjM26thD\">Notes for Mastery by George Leonard (Human Dynamics)</a></li>\n</ul>","noteIndex":{"id":"root","title":"root","desc":"","updated":1622102326440,"created":1595961348801,"stub":false,"custom":{"stub":false,"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"name":"main","fsPath":"main","useFMTitle":false},"contentHash":"2222728f026e86e75d06a6048c4f43ed","links":[],"anchors":{"personal-knowledge-base":{"type":"header","text":"Personal Knowledge Base","value":"personal-knowledge-base","line":9,"column":0,"depth":1}},"children":["9fa47ef8-a44b-4e36-929f-4aa7835b474d","6e43ea37-b3e7-44cf-aac7-31ae947d32a2","a10a1802-11d0-4557-a374-89712109cf90","0b9beaed-19ee-4124-a880-07e520da2b17","ddf3e9b2-ea12-4129-8785-06d6b82d4fcb","0od8kh0vs6izk4i96q9iwts","ja7l2h58fay05mgprfeoy6l","b4be93a8-69e3-4427-b4cd-53593c3ab387","5bbec2d1-4abe-4a2a-8bc5-5f3d4e229766","4a064a97-3d2d-4429-9a08-5b158dc7ef35","543e830d-feac-4048-8075-58c406bc1105","8875d2cf-85f8-41e8-b16d-c3707e40d74e","4k2ot7nwcxbum3rwhovp8bp","8ec37b11-59ad-4ea8-82d9-3186e7e0cd29","dOehc8Yap1zIbEqLvQvOt","b58269ed-9a0e-4213-b5b0-6d59c81d9899","b4fc6d48-17ae-4764-acdb-ec0f52707860","091b67bf-8bfa-454c-bbd3-7d84d8216229","f6fbee87-be27-471c-99bd-4af45d6a3156","fb9e4130-eaf8-425d-9039-5bc2ee876f18","4fb536a9-c146-4df3-8f30-9b2fb52a77f7","8b47xfvq6dktztt1tqe78l3","lqsff9j1rxtkpudvjc7gyn7","21ef758d-ca84-4be0-8eed-5e95ab3b4a7e","5fb5baa9-8b3d-4044-9c03-bbabfbdfe78a","2f6af89e-df82-4144-87fc-a2be66a0e657","POgyWcSIqi29tpqfP5uyS","525uy1b41n5r1x0n5oi5sio","ynuu1md2vx4ja6htrnxng9w","jpipw0gyw02z8mmb85nt9ri","sw8o1davagn5s9ucn2ojevb","wjktxwbd9221fmaqqiykr0j","5in2vitlqfoxb49ub1jiaq0","soi38xwj78hekt6zsm2iriz","2dq943idcgmfuhekg5283pi","0uv9ukugnko7q3cs3a8t4wj"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"\n# Personal Knowledge Base\n\nHi, and welcome to [Dickson Tan's](https://neurrone.com/pages/about/) personal knowledge base.\n\nThis is an experiment in note taking with the Zettelkasten method.
