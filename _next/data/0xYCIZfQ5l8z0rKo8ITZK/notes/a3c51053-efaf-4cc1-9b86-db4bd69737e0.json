Therefore, content reveals context. If I see orchids (content), I'm not in a desert (context). Conversely, if I'm in a desert, I will not see orchids.</p>\n<h2 id=\"context\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#context\"></a>Context</h2>\n<p>Context is a Latin word: con = together, text = weave. I.e, context means to weave together.</p>\n<p>Context is often invisible and in the background, which gives it its power.</p>\n<p>Context and content in separation is difficult to interpret. Context gives meaning to content. We make lots of <a href=\"/notes/86c2c093-d948-4a9b-844a-0900d2816b39\">Assessments</a> to make meaning.</p>\n<p>The prevailing context can assimulate other contexts into it. E.g, this happens with prevalent moods in companies. </p>\n<p>This seems obvious once pointed out, but we can fall into operating from a particular context habitually in everyday life without being consciously aware of it.</p>\n<p>Examples of context:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>OAR and BEL are examples of contexts. This context will determine the content (results) that you generate.</li>\n<li>Who said something, the time and place where something took place.</li>\n<li>Countries have context. The same person could drive differently - obeying the speed limits etc in one country while disregarding them in another.</li>\n<li>Companies have context. If you're in a company for a long time, it is a context that you can fit into.</li>\n<li>In coaching, disliking someone is a context. The key is to be aware of it and not allowing that to affect what you're doing.</li>\n<li>In coaching, the content (what the coachee says) reveals context. If the issue of not enough time always comes up in coaching, a typical solution is time management skills. In ontological coaching, the coach listens for the context of \"there is not enough time / money / ...\" - which becomes a very different conversation vs one about time management.</li>\n<li>Wanting to be right is normal, but this is a context. Because of wanting to be right, there is less openness to any new information that would make us wrong. E.g, no one wakes up and wants to be wrong.</li>\n<li>Likewise with the tendency to look for answers. Once answers are obtained, exploration tends to stop.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"example\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#example\"></a>Example</h3>\n<p>I did this exercise in a teleclass from Newfield.</p>\n<p>Try to interpret this statement in isolation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I think that there’s a lot of people more concerned about being precisely, factually, and semantically correct than about being morally right.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Some possible interpretations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This statement is qualitative / vague</li>\n<li>The statement is correct</li>\n<li>Statement is judgmental</li>\n<li>What does morality mean?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Given some additional information, interpret the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Interviewer:\nOne of the criticisms of you is that your math is fuzzy.
