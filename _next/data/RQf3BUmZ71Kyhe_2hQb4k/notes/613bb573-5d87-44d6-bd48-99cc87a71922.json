Each level has a salary range and they overlap: if level 4 is $125k-$155k, level 5 might be $145k-$160k. There are separate bands for base and equity.</p>\n<p>However, a higher level isn't just a free higher salary: it comes with higher job expectations. It’s better to be on the high end of lower level band. You should target a level you’re confident you can be promoted within 1 year and target the higher end of the band.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&#x26;v=hU6BVxtGd5g\">Tell the right story to avoid being downlevelled</a>. But don't try to be moved to a level where you are not capable of performing at, as that is bad for everyone involved.</p>\n<p>When getting an offer, ask the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What level is the job offer? What are the requirements for this level vs. the level above it?</li>\n<li>What is the salary band for this level? This is 100% completely reasonable thing to ask.</li>\n<li>How much is the equity worth currently? You can also ask: what percentage of the company does the equity represent? What is the valuation of the company?</li>\n<li>What is the vesting schedule? Is there a 1 year cliff? Are there quarterly vesting deadlines I should know about? Confirm whether the equity was quoted to you on a yearly basis or over 4 years.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Start negotiating once you're convinced the level is right. Target a total compensation number that’s in the upper half of the band for your level.</p>\n<p>The most reliable way to get more money is through competing offers. Consider interviewing with your 2nd or 3rd tier choices or getting a counter-offer from your current employer.</p>\n<p>If you can’t get what you want, offer to shift between compensation components but don’t back down on total compensation. In order of difficulty: base salary, equity, signing bonus. Offer to shift some base to equity first and as a last measure, ask for a larger signing bonus.</p>\n<h2 id=\"options\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#options\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Options</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/equity-for-software-engineers/\">Equity 101 for Software Engineers at Big Tech and Startups</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"mental-model\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#mental-model\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Mental Model</h2>\n<p>Don't hesitate to negotiate for e.g, $x000 more. That money is a tiny chunk of the hiring budget unless you're in a small startup. That money also comes out from the hiring budget, not by whoever you're talking to.</p>","noteIndex":{"id":"root","title":"root","desc":"","updated":1622102326440,"created":1595961348801,"stub":false,"custom":{"stub":false,"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"name":"main","fsPath":"main","useFMTitle":false},"contentHash":"2222728f026e86e75d06a6048c4f43ed","links":[],"anchors":{"personal-knowledge-base":{"type":"header","text":"Personal Knowledge Base","value":"personal-knowledge-base","line":9,"column":0,"depth":1}},"children":["9fa47ef8-a44b-4e36-929f-4aa7835b474d","6e43ea37-b3e7-44cf-aac7-31ae947d32a2","a10a1802-11d0-4557-a374-89712109cf90","0b9beaed-19ee-4124-a880-07e520da2b17","ddf3e9b2-ea12-4129-8785-06d6b82d4fcb","xavgo2ly2u896dsvnggnohg","ndup9xt1jacn3v9pr26kln9","b4be93a8-69e3-4427-b4cd-53593c3ab387","5bbec2d1-4abe-4a2a-8bc5-5f3d4e229766","4a064a97-3d2d-4429-9a08-5b158dc7ef35","543e830d-feac-4048-8075-58c406bc1105","8875d2cf-85f8-41e8-b16d-c3707e40d74e","8ec37b11-59ad-4ea8-82d9-3186e7e0cd29","dOehc8Yap1zIbEqLvQvOt","b58269ed-9a0e-4213-b5b0-6d59c81d9899","b4fc6d48-17ae-4764-acdb-ec0f52707860","091b67bf-8bfa-454c-bbd3-7d84d8216229","f6fbee87-be27-471c-99bd-4af45d6a3156","fb9e4130-eaf8-425d-9039-5bc2ee876f18","4fb536a9-c146-4df3-8f30-9b2fb52a77f7","jcnls1y69uqra0jmrd2ebkh","0o5k24w7k4bevjtzkv0hvxd","21ef758d-ca84-4be0-8eed-5e95ab3b4a7e","5fb5baa9-8b3d-4044-9c03-bbabfbdfe78a","2f6af89e-df82-4144-87fc-a2be66a0e657","POgyWcSIqi29tpqfP5uyS","86i3fjit6ss3tf80pixa2t1","a2upr28ccfqv82gj8iftf2j","im8rs32jlezgcfewoufvkov","p7def74x8kfn6ksaf9f6z68","5uj1i65mnwdh5762d9pxaxs","au3bds0pgh9qsc3awebvifc","zbl9ieoqf6ziapq2502zu4z"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"\n# Personal Knowledge Base\n\nHi, and welcome to [Dickson Tan's](https://neurrone.com/pages/about/) personal knowledge base.\n\nThis is an experiment in note taking with the Zettelkasten method.
