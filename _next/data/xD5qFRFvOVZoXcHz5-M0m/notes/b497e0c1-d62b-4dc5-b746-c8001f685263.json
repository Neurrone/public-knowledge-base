These strategies shut you off from your emotions for your own safety.</p>\n<p>However, this becomes a mood if left unchecked for too long.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Apathy</em>: turning off your emotions when there is too much pain. It is unlikely that someone is not feeling anything, they are more likely hurt and choose to shut down to protect themselves.</li>\n<li><em>Indifference</em>: selectively turning off emotions for particular things. This allows focus on things that matter, but be careful of it becoming a mood.</li>\n<li><em>Cynicism</em>: cynics are first idealists. they are eventually disappointed and they stay resigned. cynics tend to make other people feel resigned as well so that they themselves do not have to try again.\nThe skeptic is  earnestly trying to grow but is just being cautious. On the other hand, cynics are different from skeptics because they stay in a mood of resignation in the long run.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"deplay-emotions\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#deplay-emotions\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Deplay Emotions</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Confusion</em></li>\n<li><em>Lost</em></li>\n<li><em>Bewildered</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Confusion in this context is not referring to genuine confusion.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Sometimes a person says they are confused and don't know what to do, but they have actually already decided on what to do and then choose to consciously not recall that decision.
