If a shot is sour, I will pull it hotter, not longer. I only go longer when the tastes turn bad at hotter temps and it is clear that I need more yield to hit the sweet spot. But again, this is all meaningless unless you've sat down and had espresso with me and tasted what I make and said \"yeah, I like that\" or \"nope, I want something different in the cup\". Since I make espresso tailored to my tastes, my preferences are rather a moot point to everyone else...</p>\n<p>LU is great, but for me, I like the punchy character that I get with HU more than the softer flavors I tend to get with LU. Both will dial in just fine and make very similar beverages, but HU will have a higher TDS at a given ratio and thus mouthfeel and -to a lesser extent- body are increased.</p>\n<p>LU shots need to be shorter to match the mouthfeel of HU and since they are less aggressive on extraction, they require a slightly higher ratio to balance out the highs and the lows, which reduces strength and is just less appealing to my palate.</p>\n<p>Others will have different preferences, but we are splitting hairs here. Really fine hairs.</p>\n<p>For milk drinks, in not sure it much matters...</p>\n<p>Think about it this way:</p>\n<p>I pull short shots because I like the sensation of drinking them and the flavors pop. </p>\n<p>In milk, if you extract more and have a less punchy shot as the base, you make up for that by adding less milk if the final beverage size stays the same. </p>\n<p>So your option is less coffee and more milk with the tight shot or more coffee and less milk with the longer shot. </p>\n<p>Seems to me the longer shot will cut through milk more than the short shot because it is equivalent to a larger dose of coffee in a fixed volume shot. I mean if you leave the basic recipe alone and just increase the yield, you are adding solids to a fixed-size final beverage.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And here's another thread on comparative differences between the burrs:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Based on second-hand experience and looking at the geometries and reading SSP's descriptions  this is my best guess:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ULF is the one that gives you a semi-traditional espresso shot. Low outfall = more fines. But at brew range, it delivers the most clarity and the less fines. Will excel at 1:2.2.</li>\n<li>HU has the most fines at spro range, it will extract fast and short. Good if you want high ey at 1:2.2.</li>\n<li>LU is the one that has the less fines at espresso range due to the high outfall. It will extract slower and need a slightly higher ratio to reach balance. Good if you want high ey at 1:3 and mid ey at 1.2.2.</li>\n<li>98 Brew is like LU but on steroids, higher outfall, even less fines.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>LU is generally seen as better for brew than HU and more forgiving of coffee flaws but more demanding on puck prep.</p>\n<p>HU is the ultimate in clarity and has more fines so less demanding on puck prep.</p>\n<p>Then there is the new SSP Brew which like the name suggests really is for brew not espresso</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Based on this, I decided on the LU burrs.</p>","noteIndex":{"id":"root","title":"root","desc":"","updated":1622102326440,"created":1595961348801,"stub":false,"custom":{"stub":false,"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"name":"main","fsPath":"main","useFMTitle":false},"contentHash":"2222728f026e86e75d06a6048c4f43ed","links":[],"anchors":{"personal-knowledge-base":{"type":"header","text":"Personal Knowledge Base","value":"personal-knowledge-base","line":9,"column":0,"depth":1}},"children":["9fa47ef8-a44b-4e36-929f-4aa7835b474d","6e43ea37-b3e7-44cf-aac7-31ae947d32a2","a10a1802-11d0-4557-a374-89712109cf90","0b9beaed-19ee-4124-a880-07e520da2b17","ddf3e9b2-ea12-4129-8785-06d6b82d4fcb","2v4mahugninku2ftx02uly8","i4122kbi3xiayajyav0qfak","b4be93a8-69e3-4427-b4cd-53593c3ab387","5bbec2d1-4abe-4a2a-8bc5-5f3d4e229766","4a064a97-3d2d-4429-9a08-5b158dc7ef35","543e830d-feac-4048-8075-58c406bc1105","8875d2cf-85f8-41e8-b16d-c3707e40d74e","4k2ot7nwcxbum3rwhovp8bp","8ec37b11-59ad-4ea8-82d9-3186e7e0cd29","dOehc8Yap1zIbEqLvQvOt","b58269ed-9a0e-4213-b5b0-6d59c81d9899","b4fc6d48-17ae-4764-acdb-ec0f52707860","091b67bf-8bfa-454c-bbd3-7d84d8216229","f6fbee87-be27-471c-99bd-4af45d6a3156","fb9e4130-eaf8-425d-9039-5bc2ee876f18","4fb536a9-c146-4df3-8f30-9b2fb52a77f7","7vt9ciksnwii7mlhcxl19bg","ki3lxjfrdllz9yspy0qvrvl","21ef758d-ca84-4be0-8eed-5e95ab3b4a7e","5fb5baa9-8b3d-4044-9c03-bbabfbdfe78a","2f6af89e-df82-4144-87fc-a2be66a0e657","POgyWcSIqi29tpqfP5uyS","525uy1b41n5r1x0n5oi5sio","4n3zp4gaxtbtnorw873netm","v7xlkilx3i8da013kq4y1au","wuj4q8a3x239fji21wxxwey","qwmqb63bod4j9bdff1mppqq","kij368f0ed2ky1jqxq7pgta","x02e64db0jyzick9gg7cjmp","tt0wqonqkmrft41z9nvoez4","7xvi6eomxhtjdsw0i3t6z8i"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"\n# Personal Knowledge Base\n\nHi, and welcome to [Dickson Tan's](https://neurrone.com/pages/about/) personal knowledge base.\n\nThis is an experiment in note taking with the Zettelkasten method.
