When someone observes these behaviours, it causes the observer to also feel that same unsafety.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><em>Don't critique</em>: in the long run, doing this causes you to feel that things are boring / stagnant and that the system is not moving. When avoiding critique, the feeling that nothing moves (which comes from you intrapersonally) gets projected onto the system.</p>\n<p>This comes from the mental script when in survival of not wanting to appear negative and a fear that others think you act with ill intent.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Don't show weakness</em>: causes you to feel misunderstood in the long run. If there is pain that is not known to the system, this is a natural outcome.</p>\n<p>This comes from the mental script of not wanting to show weakness to be seen as contributing. \"Since everyone else also experiences pain, suck it up\".</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Don't offer ideas</em>: causes you to feel insignificant in the long run. Every idea that comes in can be disruptive and break the status quo.</p>\n<p>This is based on the fear of disrupting the system, \"don't want to be the one that shakes things up\" and appear disruptive.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Don't ask questions: causes feelings of helplessness / being unable to affect change in the long run. Knowledge is the beginning of power. Without knowledge, you cannot affect change.</p>\n<p>This comes from the mental script of \"Other people think I should have known. Asking questions means I haven't been paying enough attention and therefore, I appear ignorant or uncaring\". E.g, hearing that someone had a Miscarriage but not wanting to ask about how that person is.</p>\n<p>Not asking questions here is different from not wanting to show weakness (that I did not know).</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"preserving-trust\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#preserving-trust\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Preserving Trust</h2>\n<p>Humans have a primal fear of not being trusted.</p>\n<p>Each of these behaviours is an attempt at wanting to stay in <a href=\"/notes/4818624c-d589-4139-95cd-162b764d4fb2\">Trust</a> with others.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><em>Don't criticize</em>: an attempt to maintain trust by sincerity.</li>\n<li><em>Don't show weakness</em>: an attempt at preserving trust by competence.</li>\n<li><em>Don't offer ideas</em>: an attempt to preserve trust by staying reliable.</li>\n<li><em>Don't ask questions</em>: an attempt to preserve care.</li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<p>I personally don't quite understand the last point about preserving care as well as the others.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"backlinks\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#backlinks\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Backlinks</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/notes/79e782fc-aa78-4c22-87d3-8de75e861e2f\">Psychological Safety Workshop (Human Dynamics)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/notes/9a569d67-01fd-4c15-93b0-108a15a78369\">Organism and Environment (Human Dynamics)</a></li>\n</ul>","noteIndex":{"id":"root","title":"root","vault":{"name":"main","fsPath":"main","useFMTitle":false},"type":"note","desc":"","links":[],"anchors":{"personal-knowledge-base":{"type":"header","text":"Personal Knowledge Base","value":"personal-knowledge-base","line":9,"column":0}},"fname":"root","updated":1622102326440,"created":1595961348801,"parent":null,"children":["9fa47ef8-a44b-4e36-929f-4aa7835b474d","6e43ea37-b3e7-44cf-aac7-31ae947d32a2","a10a1802-11d0-4557-a374-89712109cf90","0b9beaed-19ee-4124-a880-07e520da2b17","ddf3e9b2-ea12-4129-8785-06d6b82d4fcb","WXbKvFelQfiQnlx6RRo7K","b4be93a8-69e3-4427-b4cd-53593c3ab387","5bbec2d1-4abe-4a2a-8bc5-5f3d4e229766","4a064a97-3d2d-4429-9a08-5b158dc7ef35","543e830d-feac-4048-8075-58c406bc1105","8875d2cf-85f8-41e8-b16d-c3707e40d74e","8ec37b11-59ad-4ea8-82d9-3186e7e0cd29","dOehc8Yap1zIbEqLvQvOt","b58269ed-9a0e-4213-b5b0-6d59c81d9899","b4fc6d48-17ae-4764-acdb-ec0f52707860","091b67bf-8bfa-454c-bbd3-7d84d8216229","f6fbee87-be27-471c-99bd-4af45d6a3156","fb9e4130-eaf8-425d-9039-5bc2ee876f18","4fb536a9-c146-4df3-8f30-9b2fb52a77f7","21ef758d-ca84-4be0-8eed-5e95ab3b4a7e","5fb5baa9-8b3d-4044-9c03-bbabfbdfe78a","2f6af89e-df82-4144-87fc-a2be66a0e657","POgyWcSIqi29tpqfP5uyS","SYeJYfNQp5GviTzBuOjJs"],"data":{},"contentHash":"2222728f026e86e75d06a6048c4f43ed","custom":{"stub":false,"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"body":"\n# Personal Knowledge Base\n\nHi, and welcome to [Dickson Tan's](https://neurrone.com/pages/about/) personal knowledge base.\n\nThis is an experiment in note taking with the Zettelkasten method.
