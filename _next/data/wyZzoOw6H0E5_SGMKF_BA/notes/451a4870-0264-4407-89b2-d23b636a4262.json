Does not need to be boiling water, just hot enough will do. This is to remove the paper taste and heat the brewer.</li>\n<li>Grind beans at medium-fine.</li>\n<li>Dont put the ground coffee into the brewer first. Instead, put the required amount of boiling water first into the brewer, then add the coffee. This makes the drawdown much faster, up to twice as fast as coffee first then water.</li>\n<li>Stir gently to ensure no dry pockets of coffee.</li>\n<li>Leave for 2 minutes to steep.</li>\n<li>Break the crust of coffee that forms on the surface of the brew. There're 2 ways of doing this, either is fine:\n<ul>\n<li>Use a spoon to stir gently.</li>\n<li>For smaller brews, shake the brewer to evenly mix the coffee and water.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>After 30 seconds, place the brewer onto the cup to start the drawdown phase.</li>\n<li>Wait for the drawdown to complete. This could take anywhere between 45 - 75 s for 15 g of coffee but varies by coffee and grinder.</li>\n</ol>","noteIndex":{"id":"root","title":"root","vault":{"name":"main","fsPath":"main","useFMTitle":false},"type":"note","desc":"","links":[],"anchors":{"personal-knowledge-base":{"type":"header","text":"Personal Knowledge Base","value":"personal-knowledge-base","line":9,"column":0}},"fname":"root","updated":1622102326440,"created":1595961348801,"parent":null,"children":["9fa47ef8-a44b-4e36-929f-4aa7835b474d","6e43ea37-b3e7-44cf-aac7-31ae947d32a2","a10a1802-11d0-4557-a374-89712109cf90","0b9beaed-19ee-4124-a880-07e520da2b17","ddf3e9b2-ea12-4129-8785-06d6b82d4fcb","b4be93a8-69e3-4427-b4cd-53593c3ab387","5bbec2d1-4abe-4a2a-8bc5-5f3d4e229766","4a064a97-3d2d-4429-9a08-5b158dc7ef35","543e830d-feac-4048-8075-58c406bc1105","8875d2cf-85f8-41e8-b16d-c3707e40d74e","8ec37b11-59ad-4ea8-82d9-3186e7e0cd29","dOehc8Yap1zIbEqLvQvOt","b58269ed-9a0e-4213-b5b0-6d59c81d9899","b4fc6d48-17ae-4764-acdb-ec0f52707860","091b67bf-8bfa-454c-bbd3-7d84d8216229","f6fbee87-be27-471c-99bd-4af45d6a3156","fb9e4130-eaf8-425d-9039-5bc2ee876f18","4fb536a9-c146-4df3-8f30-9b2fb52a77f7","21ef758d-ca84-4be0-8eed-5e95ab3b4a7e","5fb5baa9-8b3d-4044-9c03-bbabfbdfe78a","2f6af89e-df82-4144-87fc-a2be66a0e657","POgyWcSIqi29tpqfP5uyS","EW6N2lDnvYqdQ1SbsYG14"],"data":{},"contentHash":"2222728f026e86e75d06a6048c4f43ed","custom":{"stub":false,"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"body":"\n# Personal Knowledge Base\n\nHi, and welcome to [Dickson Tan's](https://neurrone.com/pages/about/) personal knowledge base.\n\nThis is an experiment in note taking with the Zettelkasten method.
